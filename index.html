			    <h5>About the Project</h5>
			    <p>
			        Away from Vermont’s town centers, roads carry travelers by hay fields
			        stretching out to the horizon, past vistas excavated from dense maple
			        forests, past small red barns with white window frames. There is a kind of
			        subtle, humming nostalgia written in these rolling pastures: a nostalgia
			        for community, for a simpler and more earth-bound past. The myth of this
			        landscape as an unchanging past is implicit in the back-to-the-land
			        movement of the 70s that brought to Vermont flocks of young city folks
			        yearning for an escape from urban life, and more recently, in growing
			        second home ownership in the state. In positioning country life as
			        fundamentally at a remove from urban living and from global forces at
			        large, these imaginaries of Vermont paint rural spaces as inert, timeless
			        havens that stay out of reach from an increasingly interconnected world.
			        The hills are pretty, and that is that.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			        But the history of the commodity dairy industry, arguably the current
			        driving force behind these pastoral panoramas, would suggest something
			        quite contrary to an isolated landscape. Beginning in the late 1800s,
			        increasing demand for fluid milk in coastal cities would bring cows in
			        increasing numbers to pasture on these hills, keeping many fields open and
			        the forest at bay. At the time, the threads tugging at physical landscapes
			        were fewer and localized, more clearly delineated in the form of contained
			        distribution networks. Today, the strands that make up the food system are
			        far-reaching, weaving together places that are distant and seemingly
			        unrelated into a web of agricultural policy and economic regulation. In
			        Vermont, the dairy landscape has come to be stitched with the shadows of
			        other places, broader trends in the food economy that dictate how farmers
			        in this corner of the United States tend to their land and animals, and
			        increasingly, whether they can continue to do so.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			        In the early 1970s, Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz preached a litany
			        for growth that would eventually crystallize into a hospitable regulatory
			        and political climate for large scale industrialized agriculture. Across
			        Vermont, what once was a mosaic of small farms is now following a pattern
			        of ballooning land ownership as herd sizes upward of 1000 cows become more
			        common. Production models have shifted, and the landscape along with it.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			        Where I live in the Connecticut River valley, a major state road skirts by
			        one of the larger dairies in Vermont: 1700 cows and growing. The white
			        roofs of the barns stretch out long and low, just hemming the horizon;
			        underneath them, cows wander freely among one other in open-layout concrete
			        pens. Here, in a region that many still view as bucolic paradise, the
			        industrial ways of food production are hidden to those who don’t see it or
			        prefer not to. Corn fields sit enveloped in borders of dense forest at the
			        end of dirt roads snaking behind uniform white houses. Secret, absolutely
			        uniform gardens, growing in a seemingly sunken topography where the trees
			        rise up high around the young shoots in early summer.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			        But while agricultural data, if read across broad swaths of space,
			        corroborate this tale of consolidation, the fine print of these data
			        reveals narratives that cut away from this story, even as they are folded
			        back into economic logics of industrialization. In the northern reaches of
			        the state, dairy leaves a larger footprint, with uninterrupted hay and corn
			        fields sweeping across the land until they meet the blurry outlines of
			        faraway mountains.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			        When I first drove through Orleans County in early July 2019, unfamiliar
			    with agriculture and the strange world of cows, I thought,    <em>So this is what dairy country looks like</em>. At the time, I assumed
			        this landscape to be merely characteristic of a county with high levels of
			        dairy production: farmers in Orleans County produced around 10% of
			        Vermont’s milk sales, ranking third behind Franklin and Addison counties.
			        But as I spent more time here, speaking with farmers, helping out in barns,
			        I began to parse through what can easily be taken as a uniform space of
			        agricultural production and to view patterns of land use as signs of
			        differentiated agricultural practices and regulations. Why does one valley grow
			        corn when the next one over stays in hay? In the Missisquoi River valley,
			        green all spring, summer and fall, the answer lies in the proliferation of
			        organic dairying in the past two decades, a turn that keeps farms small and
			        upholds the illusion of an unchanging landscape.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			        In the words and maps that follow, I try to tell the stories of this valley
			        and the economic and regulatory contours that shape it. I hope to linger in
			        these moments of contradiction on this land, how these scenes at once
			        adhere to rural images of stasis while being continuously molded by almost
			        invisible waves of industrialization and regulation.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			        The use of maps to explore landscapes and the spatial distribution of
			        agriculture is perhaps intuitive, given their ability to easily convey
			        information about where things are. However, the intentional combination of
			        maps and text in this project speaks to ongoing efforts in the field of
			        critical cartography to disrupt the authority of the map as an objective
			        representation of space. Narratives are embedded in vectorized geospatial
			        data, points and lines that paint pictures of how we have connected and
			        organized ourselves across this land. And yet while data spans time, the
			        maps made from them are often static depictions of space. Implicitly, they
			        say, <em>this is the way things are</em>, and rarely discuss how things
			        come to be. The tendency of maps to depict space as unshakable fact has
			        lent themselves well to their historical uses: to define territorial power
			        and to orient us to our surroundings.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			        But in the rising information age where data reigns supreme, the map
			        re-emerges as an analytical tool for understanding how social phenomena
			        manifest geographically. The proliferation of interactive maps and graphics
			        on news media platforms says as much about this new public orientation
			        toward data-based knowledge. With the renewed use of the map as a tool of
			        active knowledge generation by popular media, the static nature of maps no
			        longer serve the map’s main purpose, as it did when it was used
			        predominantly as a form of territorial control. I do not mean that it isn’t
			        useful to look at a map of, say,
			        <a
			            href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/go-to-the-atlas/"
			        >
			            food access
			        </a>
			        or
			        <a
			            href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/01/05/poverty-map/index.html"
			        >
			            poverty
			        </a>
			        in the United States; these maps allow us to grasp the <em>what</em> of
			        social issues. Rather, maps can go further to illuminate the <em>why</em>,
			        providing a basis upon which to build a more structural understanding of
			        how relationships of inequality settle over space.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			        An example of using maps to explore the <em>why</em> is
			        <a
			            href="https://taylorshelton.info/publication/rethinking-the-recap/"
			        >
			            Taylor Shelton’s mapping
			        </a>
			        of the relationships between wealthy and impoverished areas in Lexington,
			        Kentucky. 
			    </p>
			    		<img src = "shelton.jpg" width = 70% style = "display: block; margin: auto">
			    		<p>
			    			Shelton challenges the framing of concentrated urban poverty as a
			        standalone problem, which portrays poor neighborhoods as aberrations in an
			        otherwise functioning city. Instead, urban poverty must be read as a
			        symptom of inequitable and extractive processes of capital accumulation, as
			        demonstrated by Shelton’s map showing the links between rental properties,
			        located primarily in poor areas, and their owners that reside in
			        neighborhoods of affluence. By integrating areas of poverty back into the
			        larger system that create them, Shelton’s work sheds light on ineffective
			        policies that fail to address the root causes of urban poverty.
			    		</p>
			    		<p>
			    		    The relational and structural thread throughout Shelton’s work informs my
			    		    mapping and writing of Vermont’s dairy landscapes. Food justice and the
			    		    disappearing working landscape are similarly discussed in a way that
			    		    removes them from broader systems, as evidenced by an emphasis on
			    		    individual consumer choices as the main avenue for change.
			    		</p>
			    		<p>
			    		    Ultimately, the relationships that make up the organic dairy industry
			    		    cannot so easily be depicted in a network of capital exchange, as in
			    		    Shelton’s maps. I’ve decided on a scroll-based storytelling format here,
			    		    weaving the maps in with the text so that they serve as sentences of their
			    		    own. In this way, I hope that the maps’ interactions with quotidian moments
			    		    on the farm and the reader’s own engagement with changing data gestures at
			    		    the dynamism of rural space and how larger agrofood systems come to shape
			    		    our physical landscapes.
			    		</p>
			    		<p>
			    		    I came into this project aware of the limitations of maps to tell whole
			    		    truths. Data and maps tend to beckon conclusions out of a reader, and the
			    		    lives on these farms are in many ways irreducible. Maps can be read as
			    		    sterile; farm life—and all life—is most definitely not. Viewing the land
			    		    from 20,000 feet says little about the rhythms of farming: what it means to
			    		    be in a relationship of both care and profit with animals, to milk cows and
			    		    wonder what the next day will bring. These are stories that teeter between
			    		    the macro and microscopic, between changes observed from far away and the
			    		    hay dust caked in the fibers of a sweater.
			    		</p>
			    		<p>
			    		    Lastly, this project is as much personal as it is academic. I grew up
			    		    moving a bunch, each time to a place to which I had no connection, whether
			    		    through shared language, identity or history. I would build a home wherever
			    		    I’d find myself but would nonetheless feel a kind of unmooring at every
			    		    turn. My mother is now preparing to leave Hong Kong, the city where I spent
			    		    my teenage years and am most strongly tied to. Rent is high, and she is
			    		    unemployed because of the pandemic. It feels like another home lost.
			    		    Thinking about how places are made, how my surroundings carry a long
			    		    history and yet are in some senses as temporary as I am, anchors me to my
			    		    environment, lets me create a place for myself. I’ll be spending the next
			    		    year or two working in Vermont / New Hampshire. I find some relief when I stop to
			    		    imagine these pretty hills and forests always shifting, to in part know the
			    		    stories that have shaped them.

				There is a ribbon of farmland that begins narrow at the foothills of a mountain range inching north like an arched and twisted spine. Here are the headwaters of the Missisquoi River, a clear north-bound tendril trickling by the gentler hills to the east, forming a valley that billows and stretches into sprawling plains at the Canadian border not ten miles away. In early fall, the valley’s hillsides turn a dusty purple as trees draw in chlorophyll from their limbs, and the forest floor is littered with red leaves peeking out through the tangled mesh of grey branches. Over the hill in another valley, corn fields mark the land like tufted squares on a beige rug, shorn in succession during the autumn months until the frost begins to collect on the corn tassels, and the snarling weeds in roadside ditches have blackened. By then, the fields are the deep brown of the dirt, gouged and strewn with mangled corn stalks.
			</p>
			<p class>
				But against this withering backdrop, the farmland of the Missisquoi River valley stays green with its seamless pastures, grasslands that swell and dip as though a blanket has been tossed over the bodies of sleeping giants. In the towns of Westfield and Troy, a cracked asphalt highway cuts by farmhouses more than a hundred years old, their white siding and black shingles unchanged, and the barns behind them, many red, some turquoise, some blue. Beyond the barns: small black and white splotches in a sea of green: dairy cows, pulling at the grass until their noses brush against the earth come autumn.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a scene pressed on the front of postcards stamped and mailed across the country to grandmothers and lovers for decades, kept on fridge doors or in a box at the back of a closet, a static image embodying the pastoral ideal that has come to define imaginations of rural Vermont. But while the footprint and colors of agriculture have not changed much in the century and a half since these fields were carved out of thick forest, this valley is anything but inert.

			<h5>I. economic organic & the family farm</h5>
			<p>
			    At 3:30, the cows amble across the fields under a sky thick with darkening
			    clouds and into the barnyard. 50 black and white Holsteins, heads bobbing.
			    They pause at the water tank, drinking in heaves, before going to huddle by
			    the side of the barn where their noses push steam onto windows coated in a
			    chunky film of dust. Inside the farmhouse, Lyle Edwards Jr. finishes a
			    grilled cheese sandwich at the tiled kitchen counter, eyes the clock, and
			    makes his way across the driveway and into the other end of the barn, a
			    looming grey A-frame with bare wooden patches where shingles have sloughed
			    off over the years. It’s time to bring the cows in.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The barn is cold and dark on this early October afternoon. Lyle—or “Spud”,
			    as he’s known—flips a switch. Fluorescent panels flicker and light up a
			    center aisle scattered with sawdust and two long rows of empty stalls, each
			    wide enough for two cows. Across cracked windowpanes and red ceiling
			    I-beams, dried specks of feces and hay cling to cobwebs resembling fraying
			    scraps of pantyhose. On the right, seven calves lie in their pens. A flock
			    of sparrows perches above them on round steel bars.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Spud, 68, ambles, too, walks with his toes turned the slightest bit inward.
			    He’s tall with a greying moustache and always wears a fading green cap. He
			    checks the stalls on both sides and picks up a long white stick—“not having
			    a stick handling cows is like not having a wand when conducting an
			    orchestra.” He swings the red barn door open. The cows file in. When they
			    make it past the doorway, the cows bound down the center aisle of the barn,
			    find a stall to their liking and hop in, heaving their bodies over the
			    small ledge with their hind legs, and then sticking their heads into the
			    feeding trough to get at tufts of hay left over from the morning. Spud is
			    quick on his feet now, dancing around the cows to direct them into the
			    right stalls. A cow comes trotting in through the door.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I want you–” Spud points with his stick. The cow leaps into place.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “You go there.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I know you want to, but you can’t.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “No, no, don’t go there.” The cow reroutes. “Thank you!”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Suddenly, the huddle of cows around Spud disappears. He cranes his head
			    toward the entrance. A cow lingers in the doorway. “Come on in!” Spud says,
			    as though welcoming an entourage of dinner guests.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Spud Edwards has been farming organically since 2002. He was one of the
			    first to be certified in this valley, just as an organic milk market began
			    to sprawl across the United States. Spud was new to Westfield then, having
			    come only five years before by way of a long list of Vermont towns where
			    he’s owned his own farm or worked for another. Organic milk was new here,
			    too—at least the kind that is pumped into silver trucks and shipped to
			    processing plants, where the milk is pasteurized and bottled for store
			    shelves. Organic certification for dairy farms has been around since the
			    late 1980s, but up until 2000, there had only been one certified organic
			    dairy farmer here, and that farmer had carved out a regional market for
			    himself by making his own yogurts and soft cheeses. The rest of them, those
			    who sold their milk in bulk, had to wait for the organic milk truck to come
			    to them.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In the mid-90s, concerns over the use of growth hormones led to ballooning
			    demand for organic milk and new shipping routes for organic milk sprawled
			    across the state.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> Farmers
			    transitioned in waves. When the milk truck did come, almost everything
			    would come to look as it had before: pasture and hay fields framed by
			    blue-green mountains. In 2000, the average farm in Orleans County had 80
			    cows, and that was large for this narrow valley. Most farmers were already
			    reliant on pasture—a central requirement for organic dairy—and in many ways
			    were farming “organically” long before there was a need to label it as
			    such. In barns and on fields, farmers carried on much as they had before.
			    But a regulatory and economic calculus would come to settle over this
			    valley—one dictated by the values we embed in our food, ideas of what is
			    natural and what is good—making and re-making this valley in Vermont’s
			    pastoral reputation.

				    When I first wander into Spud’s farmhouse on a late July afternoon, he is
				    in his office, reading an article about alleged animal cruelty at a
				    14,000-cow organic farm in Texas. <em>It’s a great place to be a cow,</em>
				    the farm’s motto reads. The videos filmed by animal rights activists show
				    cows standing hock-deep in manure, calves thrown around, animals dragged
				    across concrete by their necks. The USDA would later publish a letter
				stating that the claims were unsubstantiated, but the damage was done.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a> Kroger—the largest

				    “It irritates me to see that mega-dairy model coming into organic,” Spud
				    says, in that frustrated manner I would come to know well, a string of
				    words tied together by a single breath. The office in his window frames two
				    heifers grazing on a patch of pasture,
				</p>
				<p>
				    With his 50 organic cows pastured in the summer, Spud’s farm resembles in
				    many ways the ideal American family farm echoed in mainstream conversations
				    about food and who produces it. These conversations usually uphold the
				    local, small farmer as a noble character, selflessly producing food for our
				    families and distinct from what is understood to be perversely commercial
				    industrial farms. Indeed, popular criticisms of industrial agriculture
				    often wistfully call for a return to the small family farm, suspending a
				    collective illusion that they are somehow pre-commercial—what agriculture
				    would look like if only rogue capitalist forces had not perverted it.
				</p>
				<p>
				    But the ideal of the family farm is a moving target, evolving with dominant
				    conditions of agricultural production. The family farm of 1950—say, a dozen
				    cows milked into buckets—is more likely now labeled a hobby farm than
				    anything else, not serious enough to feed the masses.
				</p>
				<p>
				    There are a few yellowing pages of an old farming magazine that Spud keeps
				    in the bottom drawer of a filing cabinet. On the front page: a younger Spud
				    grinning wide as he does now, hands in his pockets.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “This is me when I started in 1977,” Spud says, holding the pages out to
				    me. Spud was 24 when he bought his first cows—23 of them, kept on a 25-acre
				    parcel of rented land in East Peacham. But Spud had been around cows long
				    before then, all the way back to when he ran around his grandfather’s farm
				    as a toddler, a blonde head barely peeking over the barnyard fence—wooden,
				    with steel hinges that his grandfather had smithed himself.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Spud’s grandfather, Harley Edwards, was a small and stern man, with few
				    words to say but to bark at anybody that would trample down his hay on
				    their way to the brook. His was one of those sidehill farms that sit strong
				    in Vermont’s cultural landscape, with pasture creeping up a rocky knoll
				    behind the barn, land that looked like only livestock could make good use
				    of. People say this about Vermont land in general, that it is useful for
				    growing hay and not much else. It’s said by way of explaining the state’s
				    dependence on dairy, even as there is bottomland that is perfectly fine for
				    growing food, and these forested hills had supported other kinds of
				agriculture for millennia prior.    <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>4</sup></a>
				</p>
				<p>
				    The 16 cows that grazed on this hill were milked at five in the morning, a
				    deathly quiet hour in the winters and sputtering with birdsong in the
				    spring. Just shy of eight, Harley would be back in the farmhouse and sat at
				    the dining table with his Bible open. Orphie, his wife, would be finishing
				    up a full course breakfast. At noon, there’d be another full course meal,
				    and then again at five in the evening for supper. The cows would be waiting
				    to be milked afterwards. Harley would be done by eight at night, when he’d
				    slip back into the kitchen with the yellow backsplash and the cabinets
				    painted white, stirring flavorless cross crackers into a bowl of milk, the
				    Bible open beside him.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “You could set your watch by him,” Spud says. On Sundays, they’d go to
				    church and rest—Harley did, and Orphie, too, who’d spend all week cooking
				    and tending to the children and grandchildren. “They relaxed, and napped,
				    and shit like that.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    Days signposted at five, eight, twelve, five and eight again, more or less
				    the same year-round. In the summers, the hours between milking would be
				    spent out in the fields cutting hay for winter feed, or out at the quarry
				    where Harley “worked out,” as Spud and other farmer-folk call working for
				    anybody but yourself. Winter days were more up in the air—maybe some
				    blacksmithing during the day, rigging up old car parts to make farm
				    equipment. “You start the day with milking and end the day with milking,”
				    Spud says. “In between, you don’t know.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    When Spud was old enough, he’d help carry the buckets from the barn to the
				    milk house, where he’d stand on a chair and pour the milk into tall milk
				    cans that’d weigh 100 pounds when they were full. Then they’d be placed in
				    a box filled with water from the well to keep cool until a truck came
				    rumbling down the road to take them to the processor. Other days, he’d tend
				    to the calves, once taking one home to his family’s small house on a street
				    corner to raise for a few months. Or he’d idle by the barnyard fence,
				    peering at the bull in there with the cows.
				</p>
				<p>
				    There’s a wrinkled paper shopping bag that hangs on a wall in Spud’s
				    farmhouse now, kept by his mother and framed by his wife. Scrawled all over
				    it in ballpoint are things that resemble brooms with square heads: cows
				    that Spud had drawn as a three- or four-year-old. At school, he’d fall
				    asleep with his head on the desk and dream about cows out on pasture.
				</p>
				<p>
				    When Spud first talked of buying his own cows, his father would say, “Too
				    much work and no money.
				</p>
				<p>
				    It wasn’t as though Spud's father’s career was particularly lucrative—he
				    was a carpenter and worked at the quarry —but starting a small dairy farm
				    was another story altogether. Spud’s farming career came at the end of Earl
				    Butz’s time as Secretary of Agriculture under Nixon and Ford. Butz slashed
				    federal price support programs for farmers, including a popular New Deal
				    buffer stock scheme that allowed farmers to sell grain to the government in
				    times of surplus and repurchase in years of low harvest. The buffer stock
				    scheme—or the “ever-normal granary”—accounted for the inherent instability
				    of agriculture, cycles of crop surplus and failure, by using those years of
				    bounty as an automatic stabilization mechanism. In place of the ever-normal
				    granary, Butz removed production limits and implemented direct payment
				    subsidies that propped up farm income in periods of low prices,
				    incentivizing farmers to produce as much as possible regardless of the
				    market price.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>5</sup></a>
				</p>
				<p>
				    Butz’s mantra—“Get big or get out”—would soon materialize across the
				    country, as farmers folded idle land back into production, and made use of
				    new technologies that were emerging out of those same years to maximize
				    grain yields. Farms with smaller land bases or less access to capital were
				    suddenly unable to compete, bringing on a huge wave of farm consolidation
				    that persists today. In part, Butz’s directive to “plant fencerow to
				    fencerow” was responding to rising food prices brought about by a global
				    grain shortage in the early ’70s. But the 1973 Farm Bill was also
				    undergirded by a strong laissez-faire philosophy that argued food should be
				    as regulated (or deregulated) as any other commodity, despite being a
				uniquely inelastic good: we can only eat so much.    <a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>6</sup></a>
				</p>
				<p>
				    Cheap grain in the 1970s spilled over to the dairy sector, itself
				    undergoing pressures of growth and consolidation. When Harley Edwards
				    stopped farming at 75, he was just about ready to retire. But Spud tells me
				    it was more so the bulk tank that made his grandfather sell the last of his
				    Jerseys. Beginning in the early 1950s, milk processors pushed farmers to
				    install large silver tanks in their milk houses that would directly receive
				    milk pumped from the barn. They’d come to replace milk cans and made milk
				    cheaper to handle for processors. For farmers, who would end up bearing the
				    costs of the machines, it didn’t make things much easier, except to save
				the effort of hauling milk cans and buckets back and forth.    <a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>7</sup></a> Eventually the large cost
				    and increasing mandate to install them forced many to stop farming
				    altogether. By 1960, the state had lost half their farms. Farms grew; land
				    in agriculture stayed relatively stable in that same decade. The cows begun
				    eating grain. The milk was flowing, faster than ever, feeding a growing
				    glut across the United States.

				</p>
				<p>
				    As for Spud, evening milking begins at 6. He turns the radio on. The Beatles wail over
				    the speakers, dusty voices filtering through static.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Come on,” Spud calls. “Time to get to work!”
				</p>
				<p>
				    The cows heave forward on their front knees and then straighten their back
				    legs. A few stay down, their limbs tucked underneath them in a bed of
				    sawdust. They blink sleepily, opening and closing their mouths in slow
				    circles. Spud digs the heel of his boot into their rumps.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Let’s go,” he says. He walks to the end of the barn to switch on the
				    gutter scraper, a long chain with metal bars that clean out a trough of
				    manure behind the cows. It loops along one edge of the walkway and then
				    back up the other before depositing waste into a concrete-lined pit behind
				    the barn. Every few feet, manure has spilled out of the gutter in thick
				    green-brown pools.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Oh, Jesus,” Spud says, gruffly. “Look at that friggin’ mess.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Haven’t you been doing this for 40 years?” I say.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Spud laughs.
				</p>
				<p>
				    He pushes along a cart of sawdust with a flat tire he also curses on most
				    days but hasn’t gotten around to fixing. He holds a bottle of beer in his
				    left hand, pinching it against the side of the cart. He takes a swig. I
				    grab a hoe and begin scraping manure off the walkway and from underneath
				    the cows. When I’m done, I bring an empty cart to the sawdust pile out back
				    and fill it up, plunging my shovel in the pile to break up wet clumps. I
				    circle up to the hay loft and toss bales down through a hole in the
				    ceiling. Back in the barn, there’s more shit to clean. Spud finishes
				    spreading sawdust and goes to feed the cows.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Today, the cows are eating a batch of hay cut early in the summer, dark
				    green and choppy, dead flowers curled up in the mess, petals pressed flat
				    when the hay was rolled tight many months ago. In the first few weeks of
				    June, farmers across Vermont pull themselves into their tractors and take
				    the first cutting of their fields. The grass would have been growing all
				    spring, the fields speckled with yellow dandelions. Behind them, they tow a
				    hay combine, a long knife that runs over the fields until they become piled
				    thick with soft plumes of cut grass. Leave the grass out to dry and the
				    grass becomes hay. Most grass, though, becomes haylage. The grass is combed
				    into long windrows and left to wilt for a few hours, the blades beginning
				    to fall limp over another, before being rolled into large bales and then
				    wrapped tight in netting and white plastic sheeting. They stay stacked at
				    the edge of fields for months; from faraway, they look like marshmallows.
				</p>
				<p>
				    The grass begins to ferment. Chemical bonds realign, assembling broken down
				    sugars into acids. In the winter, the hay is frozen when it comes into the
				    barn and smells like nothing until the bale is unwrapped and the thawing
				    ice loosens its hold. And then it unfurls in dense sheets—the hay, and its
				    smell, like sour honey and plum wine. The cows push and pull at it,
				    grabbing large clumps at a time. Inside their mouths, a hard rim of flesh
				    at the top mashes against a short row of wide bottom teeth, breaking up the
				    hay just enough for the cow to swallow.
				</p>
				<p>
				    When there is a lot of protein in the hay—always, on this farm—the cows
				    make more milk. Their manure is also more liquid, something close to
				    diarrhea, pouring out of their anuses in a steady deluge and splattering
				    across the walkway. That’s normal, Spud tells me.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Spud feeds his cows corn, too, ground into a fine yellow and white dust. He
				    makes the round of the barn, tossing a scoop of cornmeal at each cow. The
				    powder clings to their eyelashes. The cows snatch up bits of hay where the
				    corn has fallen.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Feeding corn to dairy cows is relatively new, beginning in earnest after
				    World War II when grain prices began to fall. It’s a miracle for the dairy
				    industry. Corn is high in starch. It’s quickly broken down in the first
				    quarter of the cow’s stomach, the rumen, and provides a cheap and rapid
				    source of energy. Corn-fed cows produce more milk. Spud doesn’t feed much
				    corn, just enough to get his milk production up to profitable levels. He
				    doesn’t grow any of it, either. Most organic farmers in Vermont don’t.
				</p>
				<p>
				    When cows eat grass, made mostly of cellulose, it is fermented in the rumen
				    over the course of several days. The grass is swallowed, then regurgitated,
				    chewed, and swallowed again, the saliva neutralizing the acidic products of
				    fermentation each time. Corn, on the other hand, is fermented so quickly
				    that little cud is chewed. On a corn-based diet, the rumen goes into acidic
				    overdrive. Lactic acid shoots up the esophagus. A foam forms around the
				    lining of the rumen. The stomach is bloated with gases that can’t escape.
				</p>
				<p>
				    The tendency to push cows at the expense of their health comes with
				    thinning margins in the conventional dairy industry, which is challenged
				    with falling prices and consequently, chronic overproduction. Meanwhile,
				    the twenty-odd farmers in this valley are paid a steady premium for their
				    milk. They’re members of the Organic Valley cooperative, founded in 1988 in
				    Wisconsin. Organic Valley holds roughly a third of the market share in
				    organic milk sales with just over 1000 members who collectively govern the
				    cooperative through regional delegates. (As I write this, Spud has just
				    returned from a week in Wisconsin interviewing and selecting a new board
				    member.)
				</p>
				<p>
				    Organic Valley is one of the few cooperatives in the U.S. that have a quota
				    system to temper the inclination for agricultural commodity markets to
				    overproduce. Farmers are only paid a set base price up to a certain level
				    of production, after which the prices drop. In this way, prices have
				    remained steady, more-or-less, with the exception of a downturn after the
				    2008 financial crisis and a recent period of organic oversupply in 2018.
				    There’s less of a need to jeopardize herd health to keep the business
				    afloat.
				</p>
				<p>
				    What grain Spud does feed, he buys from Morrison’s, a grain company based in Barnet, Vermont. It’s cheaper to keep fields in pasture or hay than to grow corn without synthetic inputs—as is stipulated by USDA organic regulations—especially when Spud doesn’t feed much of it to his cows. Besides, on an organic farm, 30% of a cow’s dry matter intake must come from pasture during grazing season—120 days of the year. A 50 cow-herd needs about 20 acres to graze in the spring, and closer to 40 in the summer and fall when the grass takes longer to come back. With his 97 acres, Spud does not have the land base to pasture his cows and to grow enough hay; he buys about half of his hay from elsewhere. And he certainly does not have the land base to grow corn on top of everything else.

					 “I gotta go to the store, get a coffee,” Spud says one day after milking. The sun is just up. The hill behind the barn, trees bare of branches, is the color of a plum split open. “Wanna go? It’s a ritual I do every morning.” Spud pulls out onto Route 100. We pass by barn after barn. That farm sold out, Spud says, nodding at a light turquoise barn with a big wreath hanging above the main door. That one’s “in debt up to their ass.” I glance out the window and see green after green, no signs of failure, as though the landscape had sewn up its wounds.

					<p style = "font-size: 14px">
						It’s all a bit of a black box, a tangle of convoluted formulas that nobody—including farmers—really understand, but the regionality of milk pricing comes through loud and clear. The milk market is carved up into regional pools—Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMO)—in order to temper competition within pockets of demand and ensure stable and minimum prices for farmers. Vermont is part of a pool with most of the New England states and a few others along the East coast. Pool members all share what’s called a blend price, determined by how much of each dairy product is made in that pool.
					</p>
					<p style = "font-size: 14px"> 
						Say, one farmer sells their milk to a cheese plant that pays a federally determined price of $16 dollars per hundred pounds. Another sells to a fluid milk plant that pays $18. Both producers get $17 dollars—the blend price—out of the pool.

					<p style = "font-size: 14px">
						Now add the Class I differential to the equation. For raw milk intended for fluid milk (and not butter, chese, etc.), processors pay an additional cost depending on the location of that plant. When Federal Milk Marketing Orders began at the height of the Great Depression, that differential was calculated based on the plant’s distance from Eau Claire, Wisconsin. At the time, Eau Claire was considered the highest producer in surplus milk. The further you farmed from Eau Claire, the more you were rewarded, in a sense, for your product. 
					</p>
					<p style = "font-size: 14px">
						It was assumed that if producers were not making milk close to the plant, then the processor would have to pay for the transportation to ship that milk in from a higher-producing region. That system was more or less phased out in the ‘60s, but what replaced it was in effect the same, except that it more actively accounted for regional demand. 
					</p>
					<p style = "font-size: 14px">
						In a low-production high-demand region like Florida, farmers are paid the most. As you move north to New England—high-production, high-demand—the differential shrinks. It gets worse out West: few population centers and way, way too much milk.

					    In 1997, Organic Valley representatives came to Westfield looking for new
					    members. They met, almost 50 farmers all told, packed in a little white
					    community building tucked away by the town offices. Grain dealers were
					    there; so were seasoned organic farmers who assured the crowd that it would
					    be a smooth transition. A higher pay price was promised. Two years later in
					    October 1999, Organic Valley would start its first Vermont milk route. Six
					    months before, Horizon Organic, today a corporate agribusiness
					    conglomerate, purchased the first bulk organic processor in the Northeast,

					    If it wasn't for the premium, Spud wouldn't be farming organically. He'd
					    likely not be farming at all. Organic dairy farms can stay small, propped

					    to as a movement, a revolution, even. And yet, a true revolution, a
					    complete turning of the land toward methods of organic production, would
					    flood the market and annihilate prices for farmers. In the past two years,
					    those who've wanted to join the movement—those who've phased their land out
					    of corn and back into grass, turned their cows out on pasture for their
					    first time—have been held off from joining Organic Valley. There's too much
					    milk in the market.
					</p>
					<p>
					    Meanwhile, the farmers in the Missisquoi River valley are protected by the
					    gatekeeping of organic. The prices came first, the philosophy after. "We're
					    making a pretty good product here," Spud likes to say.

						“These fuckers are down,” Spud says, looking at a sheet with data on his cows: when they had their last calf, how many days they have been on the milk line and when they are due next. Almost all of them are pregnant. One column reads their milk production in pounds, which is lower than usual for this time of year. 
					</p>
					<p>
						“I don’t like to call them that, but I do when they’re down,” Spud says. 
					</p>
					<p>
						“I thought you loved your cows,” I say, laughing.
					</p>
					<p>
						“I do. I do.”
					</p>
					<p>
						“You just called them fuckers.”
					</p>
					<p>
						“I know,” Spud says, ashamed. “I apologized. I took it back.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Spud reads these tables on the toilet. The crinkled sheets of black digits and letters sit wedged in a pile of cooperative newsletters and bull semen catalogues under the bathroom window. Date of calving, number of days in lactation, pregnant? (Almost all of them are.) The bull semen catalogues are another collection of data tables, only these are printed on glossy pages beside panoramic landscapes of high contrast green fields and a sky the color of a summer peach. The sky fades to a deep maroon at the page’s edge; the cow, with its creamy white coat stands supreme at the center of the page, encircled by a halo of darkness. Its head is held high by a pair of invisible hands, Photoshopped out. Its udder is bright pink, swollen and crawling with thick veins. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The bulls, each sporting a name more ridiculous than the last—Rager Red, Hired Gun, Hotstuffs Hypnotic—are scored on physical characteristics like strength, stature, and rump angle, although none of these values refer to the bull itself, but rather to the daughters the bull has sired. Every few months, somebody from the Holstein Association strolls the length of Spud’s barn, dipping their head to take in the cows’ udders, teats, feet, legs, and notes down the number on their yellow ear tags. Spud’s cows, like most Holsteins, are registered in a large database managed by the HA that tracks cow’s physical form along with their dams and sires, thousands of data points spanning the globe that are eventually aggregated into averages for bulls featured in semen catalogues. 
					</p>
				<p>
					At cattle auctions, the lineage of cows is thoroughly documented in the sale book to assure buyers of their genetic purity and their production value. I join Spud one October morning at one of these auctions at a farm in central Vermont. 
				</p>
				<p> The gravel lot is already full with pickups when I arrive fifteen minutes early, caked in dirt from the dusty drive on this dry autumn day. I find Spud by the heifer barn. We take a tour of the cows.  
					
				<p>
				    “That’s a massive udder,” I say, eyeing a cow in the barn. The two back
				    quarters are bulging on either side of a deep cleft.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Oh yeah, they’re backed up,” Spud says. He looks about the barn. “They’re
				    nice.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    The milk is leaking out of distended teats, spraying out of
				    some, a slow drip out of others. The cows weren’t milked this morning.
				    Otherwise, their udders would be half as big, only part way through the
				    slow refill that ends at evening milking. Spud’s not here to buy; the cows
				    on this farm are not organic. But each cow here traces back to a dam one or
				    two generations back, themselves bred to some elite bull farmed elsewhere
				    for its semen. A dairy bull’s lineage is closely tracked according to the
				    qualities of its female offspring and their offspring, and so on—udder
				    shape, feet and legs, production volume. When the auction begins, Spud will
				    look the cow up and down, lean toward me, and over all the hollering, say,
				    “She doesn’t have a good udder” or “See, that’s a good cow there.” And then
				    he’ll note down how much the cow had sold for, thinking, maybe he’ll buy
				    that cow’s grandsire’s semen for his own herd. There’s no such thing as
				    organic semen, only cows—female, lactating cattle—who graze on pasture, and
				    eat corn grown without synthetic inputs.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Many of the cows on this farm, rarely enough, were bred with bulls raised
				    here. We find two of them pacing in the shadows of an open-walled barn. Leo
				    and Lou. It occurs to me that I’ve never seen a bull before. It wasn’t
				    particularly likely that I would have, having grown up in cities and all,
				    but the bulls’ bodies felt alien to me in a way that cows did not when I
				    saw them up close for the first time just several months before. The few
				    bulls I’ve seen on television have never been dairy bulls. They were brown
				    and squat, with violent horns and muscles that bulged under their skin.
				    These bulls are tall and lean. Both of them tower above me by almost a
				foot. When they turn to make another round of the pen, I think,    <em>their legs are so long</em>, partially because they end almost at my
				    shoulders, but also because I’m so used to seeing a large udder swinging
				    between the legs of dairy cattle that I forget for a moment that male
				    cattle don’t have udders.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “I don’t like bulls,” Spud says. “’Cause they get ugly. You can’t trust the
				    bastards. They’re mean. They’ll kill you if you let ’em, if you turn your
				    back on ’em. You never know when they’ll turn, that’s the thing. Look how
				    big they are, their friggin’ heads weigh more than you do.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Probably,” I say.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Spud pauses.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Nice looking bulls. They definitely got the bull look to ’em.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    The bulls stick their heads between the metal bars and into glaring
				    sunlight, one to plunge its nose into a pile of dry hay, the other to get a
				    closer look at us. A large brass ring has been pierced through
				    its nose. A chain, more than a foot long, hangs from the ring, its
				    links tinged with rust and shit. It clangs against the metal pen. Above its
				    bulbous eyes, the skin has gathered in tight wrinkles, deep parentheses
				    that stop at the white curls on its forehead. The head is faceted with
				    muscle. A hump rises above the neck.
				</p>
				<p>
				    A man in worn plaid walks by, and says, “That one’s mine:
				</p>
				<p>
				    “You trust bulls?” Spud says.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Yuh,” he said.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “You gonna buy one?”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “I might.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “They’re big though.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Yuh. I don’t want one that big.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “No,” Spud says. “They’re hard on cows.” And then to me: “You know, when
				    they’re on top of ’em.” He chuckles.
				</p>
				<p>
				    The man who used to run this farm is said to have been one of the best
				    cattle dealers in New England. He died a few years ago while moving cattle
				    from one farm to another—heart attack; he was 73. It is said that Sonny
				    Miller would milk his cows in the mornings and evenings, just like all the
				    dairy farmers that once lined this dusty road, only he’d be holding a phone
				    to one ear, and have another sandwiched to his shoulder as he’d make deals
				    with farmers and cattle breeders, the twisted cables swooping across the
				    barn and in between his cows. There’d be two other phones on the wall
				    trembling in a flood of calls. Now, his son is selling the farm.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Cows look good,” Spud says when we run into Shaun Miller by the auction
				    tent. “Holy smokes, they got some milk in ’em.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Yeah,” Shaun says, almost wearily. He looks past us, as if eyeing the bare
				    corn fields across the road.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Some nice udders.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Yeah, they’re a nice set of cows,” he says, quiet.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Hopefully they go well,” Spud says.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Why are you selling?” I ask.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “I don’t want to milk cows in the winter.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “What are you gonna do this winter, Shaun?”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Not milk cows.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “You going to Florida?”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “I’m gonna not milk cows.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “’Cause you haven’t missed any milkings, have you?”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “No,” Shaun says, his voice high with indignation for a moment. “I’ve fed
				    my calves every feeding this year.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Yeah see he never gets away, that’s why—now he’s burned out.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “No, I’m not burned out,” Shaun says.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “No? Just wanna take a break.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Well, no, you know I’m just breaking even. But I could do a lotta things
				    and just break even.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Without working?”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “I could do nothing and break even.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    Spud laughs. He asks about the corn across the road, who those fields
				    belong to. Shaun mutters a name, and then as Spud begins telling me about
				    corn fields turned more profitable hemp fields, Shaun scans the horizon
				    again before slipping away and disappearing into the auction tent.
				</p>
				<p>
				    There are already people seated around the auction pen, an octagonal cage
				    painted green with dried corn and hay bales marking every vertex as
				    decoration. Through the tent roof, the sun throws a yellow tint on
				    everything. By the time we find our seats, a row of people has gathered at
				    the edge, their backs stuck in sunshine, their faces cast in the shadows of
				    their caps.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Check, one, two.” A deep voice churns out of the
				    speakers. “Well folks, I’d like to welcome you here to the Ryder-Brook Farm
				    Complete Holstein Dispersal. We have about 315 head to sell to you today so
				    we have to do them rather rapidly.” Dave Rama, the auctioneer, sits at a
				    podium looking over the pen, and speaks with his lips almost brushing the
				    microphone. He scans the crowd; his eyes are slits. Black sports sunglasses
				    are perched on his large head that seems to sink into his shirt collar.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “I know that the Millers certainly need no introduction. They’ve been a big
				    part of Vermont, Holsteins, and the cattle world and agriculture for years.
				    Shaun is back here. His lovely wife is right back here as well, and I’ll
				    tell you. Shaun has done just a remarkable job, a remarkable cow man, has a
				    tremendous group of people working here on this farm.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    Dave continues for a while, pouring praise into the microphone. “Folks,
				    I’ll tell ya,” he finishes. “It is one of the sweetest-uddered herds that
				    we’ve had the privilege to sell.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    The bulls are for sale, too, Dave says, only he’ll sell them out in the
				    back pen.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Actually, we just got an announcement,” the man—Tim Abbott—sitting next to
				    him says. “Dave Rama is gonna lead that big bull in the ring. If anybody
				    wants to see that. That’ll be a lot of fun. Actually, your wife would like
				    to see that. She wishes it had horns though.” He chortles. The audience
				    titters.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Right, right,” Dave says. And then he continues.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “And I gotta tell ya some’n. If you’re in the heifer business,” he says,
				    pronouncing <em>heifer</em> like <em>halfer</em>,
				    “Shaun—I’ll tell ya—he went to Langmaid’s.,”—a renowned breeding farm in
				    central Vermont—“He went down, he said, “I like tremendous udders. I don’t
				    push my cows hard. I like tremendous udders and feet and legs”, so he went
				    down and bought some bulls from Langmaid’s out of 94, 95 point cows”—udder
				    looks are scored out of 100—“with 50,000 pounds of milk and he used them in
				    his herd. You know, I gotta respect somebody that does that because I’m
				    gonna tell you some’n. I told Tim Abbott, before he got here at crack, I
				    said the best set of heifers maybe I’ve ever sold at a sale I’m going to
				    sell at this sale. They are amazing. Best set of heifers from top to
				    bottom. Don’t have any pink eye in ‘em. They’re all right. No hernias.
				    They’re clean. They’re big for their ages, and just a sweet group of cow.
				    So without further ado, I think we’re ready to get started. Folks, we are
				    handling a few bids.” He introduces the man sat at the front of the
				    audience, who’s receiving online bids on his laptop. “That’s Chad Griffith.
				    Very handsome young man from Ohio. He’s a big Bernie supporter. We’re glad
				    to have him here.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “He’s probably the only one here,” Tim says, cackling. Dave laughs, too,
				    and then puts in his last glowing pitch for the cows before ordering the
				    first be let in. A gate on the left side of the pen slides open, and a cow
				    bounds into the pen, legs flailing. It circles around and back. The two men
				    in the pen, one with a wooden shepherd’s cane, redirects it to give the
				    audience a full look of the body, the udder, the feet and legs. Spud points
				    the cow out in the catalogue—lot number 85. The page is packed with
				    numbers, plus signs, and decimal points, names of dams and sires in bold:
				    data of the cow’s milk fat content, bacteria count, volume, the cow’s
				    pedigree. Lot 85 is the daughter of Mr. OCD Epic Dragonheart and Walhowdown
				    Secure Raspy. On other pages, dams are pictured against a Photoshopped
				    green field and a trim of forest. The cow stands stiff and regal, one
				    of its back legs stepped forward to display the udder. The coat is clean: a sheen on the black, and a raw white with the lightest of pink where the hair has been shaved close to the skin. On one
				    page, there’s a close-up of a bright pink udder, cropped and captioned in a
				    cartoonish font: “Treasure’s beautiful mammary!”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Oh, so that’s a pregnant one,” Spud says of lot 85, scanning the page.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Lot number 85, and let’s roll, David,” Tim says. And then out of the
				    speakers comes a rumbling of numbers. Dave’s tongue is rattling in his
				    mouth. His lips barely move.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Do I have a five hundred five hundred five hundred I got a thousand now a
				    twelve hundred twelve hundred and a twelve and a twelve now a thirteen a
				    thirteen a thirteen a thirteen hundred now a fourteen fourteen can I get a
				    fourteen hundred now a thirteen and a half.” Dave takes a sip of a breath.
				    Every few notes, his song pitches upward before lowering again into a flat
				    litany. He’s speaking cursive.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Thirteen and a half fourteen can I get a fourteen—what a heifer!—can I get
				    a fourteen can I get a fourteen…”
				</p>
				<p>
				    One of the men in the pen stands poised with his right hand stretched out
				    to catch new bids. With a flash of a bid number, the man calls, almost
				    screams.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Yeaap!” A blaring note, vibrating as though catching a strand of phlegm at
				    the back of his throat.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “CanIgetafourteencanIgetafourteen…”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Yeaap!”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Fourteenandahalffourteenandahalf…”

				<p>
				    “Yeaap!”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “FifteencanIgetafifteenfifteenfifteencanIgetafifteenhundredfourteencanIgetafifteen…that’s
				    a buy for fourteen and a half!” The <em>half </em>skids on and bends into a
				    higher pitch.
				</p>
				<p>
				    The cow slips out the end gate. And then it’s on to the next.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Another very good cow,” Tim announces. “She’s already very good. She gave
				    24,000 pounds out of that beautiful udder, fresh the 8th day of September
				    and ready to roll. Look at the udder on this cow”— “Whew!” Dave says—
				    “milking extremely well. She made 24,000 pounds of milk last time, David,
				    and bred right back. Beeaauutiful cow, and just fresh.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “CanIgetathousandnowtwelvehundredtwelvehundredtwelveandahalfnowthirteenandthirteennowthirteenandahalf…”
				    There’s already a lull in this sale. Dave is stuck on a price that is far
				    too low.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Thirteenfiftythirteenhundredandtwentyfivetwentyfivetwentyfivenowaquarterthirteenhundred
				    twenty five–“ Dave breaks off. “That cow is just fresh!” 
				</p>
				<p>
				    Tim jumps in, “Fresh fresh the first part of September, cow calved as a two
				    year old and a three year old.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    Dave makes a sound somewhere between a moan and a squeal.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “This cow’s gonna be a hundred-pound cow if you get her home.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    The morning slides into the afternoon. The crowd is shifting in their
				    wooden seats, leaning forward to get their bids in.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “This cow will fill your sink and tank right here. I mean that’s a milk
				    wagon.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “I’m asking thirteen hundred and this cow—look at the cleft on that udder,
				    I mean, just beautiful.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “She had 71 pounds out of that beautiful udder. Pregnant pregnant
				    pregnant!”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “88 point cow. She was fresh the 18th day of September and ready to roll.
				    Let’s sell her before she gets everyone dirty.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “That $100,000 cow, that ATM cow and a pretty big pedigree by the hottest
				    bull in captivity.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Wowwowwow.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “87 with an excellent mammary—you can see why. This cow’s giving a looaaad
				    of milk.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Look at the ring boys.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Ohhh, my dear. Fresh and fancy. Ohhh, rolling out the milk again. Here we
				    go.”

				    I’ve pushed the sleeves up on my blue sweater, its cuffs soggy and rimmed
				    in brown. Forearms: crusted with layers of iodine solution and milk and cow
				    shit, a rusty orange stippled with a muddy green. Splotchy, as though
				    someone had dribbled liquid onto a watercolor painting. I fumble blindly
				    for a cow’s teats. This one’s young, with a small udder, four quarters
				    hanging like pink tents turned upside down, so I have to reach up behind
				    the stainless-steel divider that separates us to clean her teats. I stick
				    my head under the divider to check that I’ve got all the dirt off, hoping
				    that the cow does not decide at that moment to let out a fresh turd. It
				    happens, I am told.
				</p>
				<p>
					I spent the five weeks of my winter break milking cows at a 500-cow dairy. I wanted to know what organic was made in response to, the industrial ways of food production with which most are unfamiliar. And yet with each meal, we interface invisibly with these food systems, altogether a bodily encounter with the strange. The farm I’m working at is in Canada. It’s where I could find legal work as a Canadian citizen. But the methods of dairying are, with the exception of some deviations, a mirroring of industrial dairy production in the United States.
				</p>
				<p>
				    The milking parlor is a rectangular pit a few strides wide and about the
				    length of two small cars. Milking claws, four rubber-lined metal cylinders
				    attached to a central plastic body via black hoses, hang limply on chains
				    in two long rows either side of me like huge sedated bugs. There’s 32 of
				    them, one for each cow that files onto the concrete platforms on each side,
				    their bristly hocks at eye level, their hooves smacking on a chunky sheen
				    of manure and urine. The first walks the length of the platform, reaches
				    the end of the narrow corridor, and rotates 90 degrees. As she turns, a
				    gate folds in after her and locks her into place. Her head is sandwiched
				    between steel columns. The next cow does the same. Clops along, rotates. And the
				    next, like soldiers falling into line. Soon, the view from the pit is two
				    rows of udders and the white backs of their legs. The rest of their bodies
				    are blocked off by a stainless-steel panel running the length of the
				    parlor, with consoles controlling each milking unit, a few brightly colored
				    buttons and an LCD panel. Four red digits blink, then settle: the cow’s ID
				    number, picked up off an RFID tag wrapped around their front left ankle.
				</p>
				<p>
				    The cows—480 of them—are milked three times a day in five-hour shifts. The
				    first begins at four in the morning. From the highway, the farm is a grid
				    of cold-white squares hovering over a hill shrouded in darkness: the
				    plastic siding of a long and squat barn lit from within. I find the milking
				    parlor at the end of a gravel lane. In the greenish-grey of a fluorescently
				    lit room where everywhere else is dark, the milkers are already running in
				    a chorus of mechanic inhalations and exhaliations, drawing milk through an elaborate
				    system of pipes and into the bulk tank in the next room, a steel cylinder
				    the size of a small school bus.
				</p>
				<p>
				    I am put right to work. Ben Loewith is short and lean, 44, and the third
				    generation to be running the farm. He talks fast and doesn’t so much as
				    walk but charge, his body at a permanently slight angle with the ground. He
				    hurls procedures and protocols at me. We prep and milk four cows at a time
				    in the row of 16, he tells me. He starts by “stripping” the first cow,
				    squeezing the four teats to let out three spurts of milk each. The milk
				    pools between the cow’s feet, swirling around flakes of dried manure, a
				    brown and white slurry, like cookie crumbs soaking at the bottom of a milk
				    glass. Stripping stimulates the udder, tells her body to let down her milk.
				    Every now and again, a cow is infected with mastitis and her milk has
				    coagulated into fine cheesy chunks. Stripping gives the first diagnosis.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Ben dips the cow’s teats in a iodine. He strips and dips the next three. And then it’s back
				    to the first with a blue towel. The udder stretches and jiggles
				    as he wipes the iodine and dirt off. Four cows clean. A green button on the
				    console drops the milking claw on its chain and Ben swings it under the
				    cow, bring the opening of each cup to the teats. The cups gasp before
				    latching on with a thump. Milk gushes into the central body. The rubber
				    hoses quiver.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Within five minutes of stepping through the glass double-doors, I am
				    milking cows on my own. The cows kick as I grab their teats, gritty and pale
				    with sand from the barn, or shift between each hind leg like a child
				    needing to pee. They feel clumsy in my hands, these floppy tubes, and half
				    the time, I squeeze, and the milk doesn’t come. I try different ways of
				    holding the teat. Conventional wisdom has it like this: take the base of
				    the teat—where it meets the udder—in the fleshy crook between your thumb
				    and index, pinch, and then roll the rest of your fingers successively
				    toward the palm. It doesn’t really work. I look down the parlor. The man
				    milking the other half of the room has all his cows clean, his milkers
				    attached. I’m only done cleaning my second.
				</p>
				<p>
				But milking cows at this scale is work that gets better. By the 50    <sup>th</sup>, I am stripping with my left hand and dipping with my right.
				    A second to each teat. I yank at them with the blue rag once, and then a
				    second time to rub the tip with my thumb. I think of how
				    my mother used to dry my hands after I had washed them, a five or
				    six-year old with my hands held out splayed to her, fingers stinging from
				    the friction of her grip. When I’m done with the rag, the teats are a baby
				    pink, the color of a cartoon pig, and so bloated with milk that they’re
				    almost shiny. Even so, grains of sand still cling inside the small crater
				    of the teat opening. I leave them like that; there are more cows to clean.
				    Besides the vacuum will whip the sand through a gurgling pipe of milk and
				    then a dense fabric filter with catch it alongside microscopic specks of
				    shit and cow hair. When the sensor picks up a slowing milk flow, the claw
				    automatically drops off, jolting back on its chain like a playground swing
				    after a child has ejected themselves. The teats will be spotless then; the
				    tips are an almost translucent white, like the unraveling ends of a boiled
				    sausage.
				</p>
				<p>
				    My boots slip on the slick rubber mats. I slide between the cows, shaving a few seconds off this new dance I’ve learned. Strip, dip, then wipe. Attach claw. I glance over my shoulder to check on the other row of cows. I can tell from a loud hissing that a cow has kicked off her milker. It lies on its side, tubes twisted, in a steaming pile of fresh manure. I hose off the milker, check the cups for clumps of shit, and then reattach her, milk spraying on my wrists. I slide back to the other side. Strip, dip, strip, dip. I’m moving as fast as I can, trying not to catch any snags in my routine. But then there are the cows with the rear teats so close together that they crisscross, and the milking claw—designed for four evenly spaced teats—sits awkwardly, squawking and squealing as the cups slowly slip off. Or the cows that stand too narrow, and I have to wrestle the machine between their bony knees. By the time I’ve managed to attach all four teats, I’ve leaked a bunch of air into the system, the vacuum loses pressure and the cups fall. I lose my patience a few times, curse and stand with my hands on my hips, sigh and then try again. Over time, things get even easier, and annoyances lose their sharp edge. It’s just part of the job. By my third shift, I feel like I’ve fallen into stride with this cadenced beast, like I’m an appendage on a machine that makes sure it runs.

				    The cows get used to anything, too. Every few days, a cow comes into the
				    parlor and doesn’t know how to turn. She files into the narrow corridor
				    after the others, but as the gate folds in after the cow before her, she
				    stops short. Her head is bowed, her nose inches from the floor. She glances
				    around. She swings her head toward me, black with a white triangle on her
				    forehead, and then away again. She paces on the spot. I tap the back of her
				    leg.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Come on, bub,” I say. She doesn’t move.
				</p>
				<p>
				    I grab the pink plastic cane hanging at the end of the parlor and poke her
				    face. The round end of the cane bunches the skin over the flat bone of her
				    muzzle. She blinks, pin-straight black eyelashes flickering, then she bows
				    her head even lower and turns into the stall.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Slippery, mauve strands of translucent membrane hang out of her vagina, at
				    the bottom of which swings a kidney-shaped pocket of pink fluid the size of
				    my palm—the remains of a calf’s placenta born a few hours before. She’s
				    “fresh”, in industry language. The calf was her first; this was her first
				    time in the parlor, in this alien cacophony of staccato breaths.
				    She’s not my cow to milk. Her stall is on the other half of the parlor,
				    where Cookie is working. Cookie is a tall, stocky man of about 50, has kids
				    that are my age. He hates the swinging placentas. He jabs his finger toward
				    her.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Your cow,” he says. “Your favorite.” He’s smiling, but I know he’s serious
				    about passing her off to me.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “No, your cow,” I say. I smile back, and then go back to wiping the sand
				    off my own set of cow teats.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Cookie doesn’t speak much English. He’s from Pakistan originally, and
				    worked on dairy farms in Italy for more than a decade before coming to
				    Canada. We speak in monosyllables. A few minutes pass. The clockwork rhythm
				    of the milkers crescendo. Then Cookie tries again.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Your cow,” he says.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “No!” I say, laughing.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Cookie furrows his brows.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “You go front.”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Wait, why?” I ask. I had seen new, fresh cows come into the parlor before,
				    but hadn’t seen anybody go and stand in front of them.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “She. Heifer.” Cookie says. “She kick!”
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Okay, but what do you want me to do?”
				</p>
				<p>
				    Cookie barks something short and waves me off. I roll my eyes and clamber
				    up onto the platform where the cows stand. I find the cow in the long row
				    swinging her head low left and right. Thin white steam tumbles from her
				    nostrils, curls back off the concrete floor and around my boots. I hear the
				    hiss and clang of the claw dropping on its chain and into Cookie’s hand,
				    and then another hiss and thump as the first cup latches on. She jerks
				    forward, her broad shoulders jamming up against the metal braces around her
				    neck. I kneel down and hold her collar, because that seems like something
				    to do, then the base of the ears, a small nob of muscle where cows like to
				    be scratched. Hiiiissssss-thump. Hiisss-thump. She heaves forward again.
				    Her udder swings. I hear Cookie curse as the milker falls off. I rub her
				    forehead, a grey-white patch of short half-ringlets.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “It’s okay,” I whisper. “It’s okay.” I feel a little foolish reassuring an
				    animal that will in a few hours be in the same spot, still trying to kick
				    off this thing clinging onto her udder.
				</p>
				<p>
				    She stops swinging her head after a while, just keeps it low. The floppy
				    skin on her belly quivers. The cow to her right rests her pink muzzle on
				    the spine of her neck. In a few days, she will be broken in, the gasping
				    machines no longer a shock to her. Today, the mechanic calf suckles,
				    pulling a thick yellow milk from her udder and into a plastic white pail.
				    This is the first milk—colostrum, a milk rich in antibodies, natural
				    disease prevention for the newborn calves waiting in their plastic and
				    plywood hutches outside to be fed from a plastic bottle with a red rubber
				    teat.

				    At 8:10, the morning sun has thrown a parallelogram of light through the front doors and onto a cow’s udder. I dip her teats in the
				    post-milking iodine solution, more concentrated than the pre-dip. Earlier,
				    it had reminded me of molasses. In the light, it’s a deep, pretty, red. I
				    glance at the holding pen. It’s empty. <em>Finally done, </em>I think. I
				    take my time dipping the next few cows. Then, I hear the quiet patter of
				    hooves on concrete. I look back to the pen and see a wall of cows coming
				    for the parlor, their black and white backs like waves on a restless ocean.
				    Their heads sway. Some chew their cud, their mouths a frothy mess. They’re
				    cute. But there are at least 90, maybe a hundred of them. I dip my cows faster now. I’d like to be done
				    before 9.
				</p>
				<p class = "p-break">
				    ____________
				</p>
				<p>
				    Every day, I plan to stay and watch the cows and the people, and then 9
				    hits and I’m ready for the long mindless drive back to suburbia, where I’m
				    staying for these few weeks, my torso hunched over the wheel, my spine a
				    limp noodle. By the third week I’m there, my body is less worn. I grab a
				    cookie from the lunchroom, and wander around the barns, stopping to chat to
				    the cows. The barns are long and cavernous things—free-stall barns—open on both ends and divided into four sections where the cows wander as they wish. Most of them rest in stalls bedded with sand. A few stand in the concrete walkway. There’s one stall for every cow—normal for Canada, rare for the U.S. where industry experts encourage over-crowding while
				    still optimizing for production. Comfortable, but not too comfortable.
				    Black clouds of swallows swirl and pitch under the vaulted ceiling. It’s
				    nice in here.
				</p>
				<p>
				    At the end of one barn, I find a man with a thing that looks like a phone
				    booth from another world. Red, rusty, all jigged up with pulleys and
				    pneumatics and lightbulbs. It's familiar, in a way. The red reminds me of Chinese wedding litters, a
				    square frame with an opening in the front and back, the steel and
				    lightbulbs—incandescent and burnt-orange light—of Hong Kong street stalls
				    in which old men in baggy white undershirts tinker with broken watches.
				    It’s a hoof trimming jig. A cow files in on one end and a door on the other
				    opens and clicks around their necks. Randy, the hoof trimmer, is wearing a
				    padded jumpsuit and has the hood of his sweater pulled up and cinched
				    around his face. It’s cold out, and besides, he doesn’t want the chips
				    going down his shirt. Randy flips a few switches and the back of the
				    machine rises up, pneumatic columns hissing, and a band comes up under the
				    belly of the cow and lifts her onto her toes. A robotic arm—mechanic, not
				    digital—grabs onto one of the cow’s back legs and brings it off the ground.
				    Suddenly, the cow is doing yoga, leg stretched out straight behind her.
				    Randy takes a circular grinder and goes at it, and the bottom of her feet,
				    usually caked in shit, returns to a creamy white. Hoof chips go flying. I
				    pick up one of the shavings and it reminds me of parmesan cheese flakes,
				    only when I go to rip it, it doesn’t crumble. It rips like plastic.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “I’m returning the hoof to its
				    natural state,” he says. He’s ground out a hollow in the center of the
				    foot, two half-circles on each claw. Cows feet are harder around the edges;
				    that’s where the pressure should be. Out on pasture, the dirt grinds away
				    at their hooves. Here, where cows walk on concrete and have never seen a
				    live blade of grass, the hoof trimmer comes a few times a year to fix their
				    feet. Some cows limp, their toes overgrown or their soles worn through to
				    the flesh. On these cows, Randy glues a block of wood to a harder part of
				    their foot. The cow will walk on it as keratin builds up
				    over her hoof again.
				</p>
				<p>
				    Carl—72, Ben’s father, a short quiet-mannered man—comes by to feed a calf that was born
				    an hour earlier. The calf is almost all white; her fur is a mat of hardened
				    curls. He has a bottle of murky teal liquid to disinfect the
				    umbilical cord, and another bottle to feed the calf with. He also carries what
				    looks like an IV fluid bag with a long plastic blue pipe. That goes down
				    the calf’s throat if she doesn’t want to drink. But she does, and Carl
				    holds the bottle until it’s almost empty and white saliva is strung between
				    his fingers.
				</p>
				<p>
				    The calves rarely drink directly from the mother. “We’ve pretty much disrupted the mothering
				    instinct in cows,” Carl says. The calves never get enough if they drink from the
				    mother, he says. The cows don’t teach their babies how to drink. Beef
				    calves, he tells me, always get enough—we don’t milk beef cows and besides,
				    if they don’t drink, they die. On dairy farms, the farmers
				    bottle feed them colostrum-rich milk from another fresh cow. Or they mix in
				    colostrum powder with regular milk.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “We’re perpetuating the problem,” Carl says. He sounds a little forlorn, but
				    I’m so surprised by what he’s telling me that I don’t think to ask how he’s
				    feeling.
				</p>
				<p>
				    The mother cow, who’s been lying idly by, stands up, and one of her hooves
				    catches the calf’s back leg.
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Hey,” Carl says, sharply. He taps the
				    cow’s leg. “Don’t step on her.”
				</p>

					“Have you tried raw milk?”

"I’ve been married, divorced and gone through the mill and started over again. I had three kids. My youngest girl died in a car accident when she was 18. I went through bankruptcy and divorce at the same time.” He turns the jug over a few times. The milk gurgles, the skim beginning to cut through the fat globules of cream.

						When Jacques Couture—“Jake Coocher”—slips out of bed at 4, careful not to wake his wife, it is still dark outside, the wide window by the dining table downstairs a panel of night, save for the blinking red lights of wind turbines over the hill, and—with eyes tuned to the dark—the white-green tips of frost-bitten pasture. Jacques closes the kitchen door gently behind him when he leaves the house to the farm store stocked with maple syrup and candies, and then he is through another door to the garage, where he pulls on a pair of black rubber boots.
					</p>
					<p>
						The dirt path to the barn is narrow, barely wide enough to take a regular stride, and cuts neatly through a well-kempt ring of grass around the house. By the time Jacques is on this path, the lights in the barn are usually on, and the cows already fed. But this morning, the barn is dark. Dave, the farm hand, must have stayed out late last night. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Even with the lights on, the barn is a collection of deep shadows. At the center of the barn, where it is lit by a single sparse row of light bulbs, the cows are more of a burnt orange than their recognizable black and white. They stay in here all day and night in the colder months, all 70 of them loosely chained at the collar to three aluminum frames that run the length of the barn such that they stand or lie shoulder to shoulder in three neat strings. In front of them, Jacques deposits long heaps of haylage, a brown mash of coarsely chopped hay fermented at the height of summer. It smells like sour honey. The cows bow their heads into their morning meal. Soon, the barn is a muted orchestra of clinking chains.  
					</p>
					<p>
						In one corner of the barn, a woman sings about love and strength over the whispering, crackling radio. Jacques carries a milking apparatus to the first cow, holding both hands high in the air so the plastic tubing and milking claw don’t drag on the floor. When he is milking, Jacques wears a portable chair strapped to the seat of his pants, a one-legged metal stool with a spring at the base. The leg hangs loose, swings when he walks. The seat slaps his pants. The metal joints whine. Jacques wedges himself between two cows. He plugs the milker in, slotting the hose into a steel pipe circulating the barn. He hangs the milk claw up on a hook by the pipes. Jacques squats. The metal leg catches him, the third leg of a half-human tripod. He draws a bottle from his belt. When the bottle is squeezed, the cap is filled with a solution the color of a melted creamsicle: hydrogen peroxide, to clean the teats.
					<p>
						A young bull with a coat thick with curls paces about at the length of its chain, burying its hooves in a layer of overnight feces. It stands at eye-level with Jacques; in a year or two, it will tower over him. On his way to detach a milker, Jacques pauses to cup the bull’s jaw with his left hand. He leans close and murmurs something, the sound of his voice smothered by the whir of the vacuum pulling milk through metal pipes overhead.

			<h5>III. grassroots organic</h5>
		</div>
		<section class = "non-scroll">
			<p>
			    One morning in early July, one of those days when the sky hangs low and tamps down a still heat onto dust, I set up Interstate 91 to see a dairy farmer who is said to be a pioneer of alternative agriculture. I wanted to learn about the history of organic dairy, and I was told that it began on Jack Lazor’s farm, Butterworks Farm, more than 40 years ago. I was compelled by his story, too, by the strong philosophical commitment to agriculture that is good for the earth. Organic, not just for the premium, but as an intentional reflection on how the food we grow relates to other living things. I looked up to it as something I might want for myself someday. Jack had grown up in suburban Connecticut, gone to Tufts and decided that he wanted to “return to the land,” as it were. At the height of his business, Jack’s yogurt sold at Whole Foods stores in New York City and Boston, shipped down from his tiny farm in Westfield, a little town unknown to most. And all the while, young people have come from afar to learn how he built something from seemingly very little, who’ve gone to start their own farms.  I was drawn to the romance of it all: the triumph of the small farm, hard work, simple living, tucked away in the Green Mountains. 
			</p>
			<p>
			    I-91 skirts along the western slopes of the Connecticut River valley. It is
			    hay fields to my left and to my right, and clusters of buildings at every
			    exit, first larger complexes closer to home, and then as I move north, a
			    scattering of brick and white vinyl. A lone gas station here and there. I
			    pass through Barnet. The Passumpsic River comes in under me, signaling
			    entry into The Kingdom. It’s hard to say what came first, the quiet and
			    rugged myth of this corner of the state or the name—the Northeast
			    Kingdom—that decidedly ensured its existence. In any case, after George
			    Aiken in 1949, then senator of the state, blurted it out in a development
			    meeting for the three counties flagging in poverty, the name stuck. There
			    is, of course, no king in neither Essex, Caledonia nor Orleans County, but
			    there is something about this place—something about the empty roads and
			    thick forests and small, weathered buildings. After St. Johnsbury leaves my
			    rearview mirror, I could swear there are more rubber-lined cracks in the
			    asphalt, that there are more crows here picking at the black-pink flesh of
			    tire-streaked opossums.
			</p>
			<p>
			    I peel off the interstate in the town of Orleans, and then turn left for
			    Irasburg. Here, the road skirts by a hulking wall of dark silver granite. A
			    gateway of sorts; a steep hill beyond. I begin to climb and then descend
			    into the Missisquoi Valley, crossing state highways and narrow bridges with
			    vegetation curling along its edges, trundle along backroads that turn from
			    asphalt to dust. I stop for a turkey, who dashes in front of my car,
			    hesitates and then disappears into the forest, brown feathers rustling a
			    bed of ferns. And then a wooden tower emerges over the crest of the dirt
			    road. A looming grey rectangle with a triangular roof and a severe spire. A
			    steeple, dark against the blisteringly white summer sky. This, I would
			    later learn, is Jack Lazor’s granary, which stands empty today on his farm
			    where the cows have fed on not a single morsel of grain for the past few
			    years, but only on grass and hay and molasses. Grass-fed: the latest in
			    Jack’s prophecy of what will save the earth.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Jack’s house sits below the rest of the farm, cradled where a gentle slope
			    blends into flat pasture. I find what I think to be the front door—although
			    it’s hard to tell with all the tools stacked up around it—and peer in
			    through the windows. A small figure, swallowed by a brown recliner, a faded
			    red blanket piled on his lap. Chin to chest, he peers along his nose and
			    waves me in.
			</p>
			<p>
			    He wears an old plaid shirt with the right sleeve cut off. Bright red
			    plastic tubes sprout from Jack’s right upper arm and the crook of his
			    elbow. The tubes swoop down and loop up to the dialysis machine in the
			    corner. It hums a high tune against a hushed beat. At 68, Jack’s hair and
			    beard are leached of color, and it looks as though he’s been standing out
			    in a windy field with how his hair is swept to one side. Years before, that
			    would have been true, but the only place he’s been since the first hours of
			    the morning is in this chair, waiting, as the machine pulls the blood from
			    his body, through the dialyzer and pushes it back into his veins.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We were one of the first,” Jack says, as soon as I settle in. He speaks
			    softly, his words deep and rounded off with a musical lilt.

					    Jack and his wife, Anne, found their first footing in Irasburg, Vermont, a

					    It was the May of 1975. The nights were crisp and wet with spring rain; the

					    One, Jack’s old pickup, the other, a hulking farm truck—1937 Chevrolet, one
					    of those with the bulging fenders over 50-inch wheels, a dark teal and
					    patched together with a body they had found at a junkyard. The back was

					    They had bought all of this at Amish farm auctions in Wisconsin, where Anne
					    had just finished college and Jack had gone to join her, hitchhiking across

					    stopping. Across northern New York and slipping through Hazen’s Notch, a
					    narrow mountain pass in the northern Green Mountains. And then they were in
					    Irasburg, the choice of this town almost arbitrary if it weren’t for some
					    friends who were renting out a little house and a little barn. They were

			    They had bought all of this at Amish farm auctions in Wisconsin, where Anne
			    had just finished college and Jack had gone to join her, hitchhiking across
			    New York state and riding buses through “the dregs of all those Midwestern

			    here in search of a past, and these lands seemed to offer it up. It had
			    this mystique, Jack tells me, something he couldn’t quite describe but
			    places in the juxtaposition of farm and forest.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Jack and Anne pulled into their house in Irasburg, a few miles down a dirt
			    road. In a few days, they would buy a cow, a small Jersey, and name her
			    Pet. That summer, Jack planted six acres of flint corn. Raccoons destroyed
			    the crop that summer, but it was the beginnings of what would become a
			    40-year journey in growing grain that would culminate in a 400-page book of
			    advice. Few grow their own grain—it’s been mostly left up to the large
			    wheat and corn farms out west where growers buy new seed each year from the
			    usual lineup: Cargill, Syngenta, Bayer. As people grow more interested in
			    local food, mostly produce, grain has been slow to fall into step; for
			    Jack, it was a key to self-sufficiency.
			</p>
			<p>
			    He had first encountered grain-growing a few summers before at a
			    19th-century historic farm-museum in central Massachusetts, harvesting rye
			    by hand with a reaping hook, a knife that curves violently into a sharp
			    question mark. Jack and Anne had met here, too. Jack had dressed in
			    costume—a vest, a shirt ballooning at the wrists, a straw hat—and guided
			    visitors through a panorama of New England life in the early 1800s. Anne
			    wore a costume, too—a bonnet, a dress with ruched sleeves and a pleated
			    skirt. Leather boots, too, for the both of them, although neither were
			    convinced boots were that nice back in the day. Old Sturbridge Village is a
			    charming place, replete with covered bridges and horse-drawn wagons, a
			    snapshot of time brushed in veneer, the toiling standard of 19th-century
			    living chamfered away.
			</p>
			<p>
			    When Jack first told me about Old Sturbridge, I imagined a collection of
			    buildings lived in, abandoned, then made new again by a history enthusiast.
			    But Old Sturbridge Village was never a real village. Born in 1872, its
			    mastermind Albert B. Wells had in the later years of his life become
			    fascinated with the trinkets of post-revolutionary America. He had by 1935
			    accumulated so many items—hand-smithed tools, frail painted porcelain,
			    weathered book plates—as to fill his mansion in Southbridge, Massachusetts
			    and then two barns beyond. When that was not enough, Wells and his brothers
			    purchased an old farm by a ruffled stretch of the Quinebaug River in the
			    late 1930s, and commissioned a landscape architect to build new 19th
			    century buildings—“authentic” was a key word—going so far as to order old
			    mills and barns be plucked from elsewhere and arranged on this patch of
			land into a fictional swatch of history.    <a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>9</sup></a>
			</p>
			<p>
			    At the time of Wells’ fanatical interest in things of the old,
			    industrialization had long paved the road out of self-sufficiency, and
			    farmers no longer grew food for self-sufficiency but for markets brought to
			    their doorstep by railroad. Beginning in the mid-1800s, fields of oat,
			    wheat, rye, turnips, potatoes, were slowly uprooted and replaced with
			    single crops destined for burgeoning urban markets.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Even before Old Sturbridge, Jack had carried an idealized vision of
			    self-sufficiency. When he was a student at Tufts University, he had read
			Helen and Scott Nearing’s <em>Living the Good Life</em>, subtitled    <em>How to Live Sanely and Simply in a Troubled World</em>. The book
			    chronicles the retreat of a couple from New York City into the central
			    folds of the Green Mountains at the height of the Great Depression. Here,
			    removed from urban life, the two of them erected a rigorously
			    self-sufficient model of rural living. A stone and timber house, built in a
			    rough patch of overgrown forest. Inside, exposed hand-hewn rafters and
			    wood-paneled walls. Floors made of stone. It was not an adoption of rural
			    ways already present in 1930s Vermont, however, but of a life pegged to
			    earlier, seemingly unsullied, panels of time. Vermont in the 1930s, let
			    alone in the 1970s when Jack and Anne came, had already been so thoroughly
			    animated by human activity for thousands of years and in more recent
			    history bound to the flows of commodity agriculture, a marionette contorted
			    by invisible strings.
			</p>
			<p>
			    This landscape of open fields and forest saw its first iteration with the
			    mass migration of white settlers to Vermont in the late 18th century. In
			    the decade following Vermont's admission to the union in 1791, the
			    population nearly doubled. Forests were rapidly cleared to make way for
			    farmland. Early on, the trees were girdled; a strip of bark would be hacked
			    away from the base of each tree in a narrow ring. Over several years, the
			    roots would wither, cut off from the sugars made in the leaves. In later
			    years, the trees would just be felled and left to dry over the winter. The
			    land cleared faster this way.
			</p>
			<p>The logs would be sent down river to become lumber or burned to make potash, a chemical compound that'd be leached from the ash in big wooden vats. Even then, Vermont was overlain with pathways of global trade: the potash would be exported to England for use in its growing textile industry. For most settlers, the additional income went toward paying off the land.</p>

			    But even as these pastures were excavated from maple forests standing
			    centuries tall, even as this grass was then groomed by cows that made milk
			    that was then trucked to cities, an image of secluded wilderness
			    nonetheless stood in for Vermont. Of the people, the Nearings write, “They
			    were as removed from modern civilization as if they had been born in some
			    remote Alpine village. We had crossed a wide chasm when we moved from
			    downtown New York to this isolated spot.” The Nearings came to free
			    themselves of economic weights, to “make it more difficult for civilization
			    to impose restrictive and coercive economic pressures.” Jack and Anne came,
			    because of this: “We were damned if we were going to be part of the
			    capitalist system.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    They stayed in Irasburg for a year, and then they went looking for land of
			    their own. It was the last week of May in 1976. They knew what they’re
			    looking for. Not land on a steep side hill—that’s bad for growing grain—and
			    the soil needed to be well-drained, wet enough for plants to grow, but not
			    so wet that they will drown. They rounded the corner onto a dead-end road
			    and they see it: grassland as flat as a pancake, oh so green with a spray
			    of yellow early-summer dandelions. Anne had 20 thousand dollars of her
			    family’s money squared away for graduate school. They bought 60 acres of
			    this land.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In a few years, they would have built this house, where Jack and I now sit.
			    Wooden beams hold the ceiling and walls, a warm brown, knotted in some
			    places and flecked in spots with termite holes. ­We’re in the living room,
			    a tight space, Jack in his recliner, me on the couch where the
			    cloud-filtered morning sun has poured a soft haze onto the gray-blue
			    fabric. The dialysis machine clicks a few times, as though it is shifting
			    gears, and then the whirring starts up again. A few feet away in the
			    kitchen, Anne is preparing a fish chowder, pulling bags of frozen filets
			    from the freezer and leaving them in the sink to defrost. Every now and
			    again, she ties on a yellow medical apron and comes by to check on the
			    machine, punching at buttons through a face mask she had worn earlier and
			    chiming in on Jack’s story.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “The organic dairy industry has kept evolving,” Jack is saying. “And I’ve
			    always felt that we have been ahead of the curve. It just comes with being
			    a pioneer, I think, or something.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Anne cuts in.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Well no, you got some influence early on. There were people that studied a
			    lot about alternative agriculture and stuff like that. Right in the area,”
			    she says. “How would you sum up what”—somebody, I don’t catch the name—
			    “had to offer? He was really into the soil.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “No, he was much more minerally based, I think,” Jack says.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “That’s true.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We were the first people to build a bedding pack barn for cows,” Jack
			    continues.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We weren’t the first ones.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Yeah, we were the first ones in dairy!”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Nope.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Yes, we were!”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Jersey Girls. We went and visited them before.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Okay. Jersey Girls. Hers was a lot different.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Anne cuts in again, talking over Jack. “And then there was that one over in
			    Sutton.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    They go back and forth for a few more seconds and then Anne laughs. Jack
			    smiles.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Glad you’re here, Anne,” I say.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “She keeps me humble, you know?”
			</p>
			<p>
			    And then after chatting for a while, Anne pulls off the medical gear and
			    heads back to the kitchen, sometimes stopping by the food dehydrator next
			    to the dialyzer to grab a tray of something—pumpkin seeds, mostly, on the
			    days I visit.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The kitchen island is spilling over. Plastic yogurt containers, bowls of
			    spare change, an old juicer, a candelabra coated in wax
			    hardened mid-drip, dusty brown bottles of essential oils. A small corner is
			    left bare for cooking.
			</p>
			<p>
			    When Jack and Anne moved here, they brought three of their cows along—Pet,
			    and her heifer, Nutmeg, and hers, Sundance.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “You gotta breed these cows to have them give milk,” Jack says.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Three became six, became 12, became too much milk.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “The nature of cows,” Anne says from the kitchen.
			</p>
			<p>
			    They began making yogurt on their wooden stove, wide with heavy circular
			    panels that they would lift to pile in split logs from the top. These days,
			    it’s all done mechanically, the cultured milk poured into plastic
			    containers and then pushed into an incubator to sit. But back then, the
			    milk would be poured into a cream separator, into the wide metal bowl up
			    top. One of them would crank the handle. It would be hard to get started,
			    and then the crank would pick up momentum, and the machine would get louder
			    and louder until it was a high-pitched buzz. They’d turn a lever to let the
			    milk flow into the spinning chamber, where the heavier skim milk would flow
			    to the outer edge, and the cream would gather in the center. And then out
			    of one spout would come trickling pale-yellow cream, out of the other, a
			    ghostly stream of skim milk.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Heat milk; let it boil for a spell. A thin skin, first smooth, and then
			    wrinkled at the edges by heat currents, collects on the surface. Turn off
			    the stove. Let the milk stand, until it is as cool as bathwater. Stir in
			    live culture, a cocktail of bacteria. Let sit. Wait. The bacteria respire,
			    converting lactose to lactic acid. The milk sours. Proteins disassemble,
			    the acid pulling at their bonds, and then coalesce again into a molecular
			    structure, larger than before. The yogurt has set.
			</p>

			<p>
			    It began as a whisper, this thing we have come to call a movement, just a
			    handful of them—dairy men—gathered in farmhouse kitchens to share ways they
			    have been tending to the land. It was the late 1980s, and there were
			    starting something, or maybe they weren’t, because there was a name already
			    for what they were doing: organic. But few had written about cows: what was
			    allowed, what was not. Some had come because the vet came more often than
			    they used to in their grandfather’s day, or the fields seemed to be needing
			    more to grow just about the same. Others, like Jack Lazor, had come to
			    Vermont from the suburbs and the cities to connect with the land. Being a
			    so-called conventional farmer, being tied up to “industry”, was just out of
			    the question. By then, Jack, in his mid-30s, had more than a decade of
			    farming behind him, and he doled out advice in these meetings—how to grow
			    grain for cows or where to find it, how to keep a herd healthy, how to grow
			    a rich forage by tending to the soil.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In a few years, Jack and his friend Peter Young would help draft the rules
			    for organic dairy certification in Vermont, and the first farm to be
			    certified—not his, he would be third—would become organic-with-a-stamp in
			    1990. Soon, organic certification for dairy made it across the country,
			    first in pockets via other state certification agencies, and then across
			    the country with the nationalization of organic standards in 2002. And in this way,
			    organic dairy is said to have begun on this farm.

			    Jack thinks about the yogurt section at the grocery store in feet. Back in
			    the early 1980s, when Jack and Anne were just putting out their stovetop
			    products, it was four, five feet long. These days, it’s a glowing
			    twenty-odd feet and a splatter of color on plastic tubs and cups and tubes.
			    Americans don’t drink much milk anymore—consumption has been falling since
			    the end of the Second World War—but yogurt has been on the rise. In 1970,
			    per capita consumption of yogurt sat at 2 pounds per person. By 2018,
			    people were eating 13.4 pounds, about seven big tubs of the stuff a year.
			    But Jack’s sales are low.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “When did it feel like it was slipping?” I ask, trying to pin down a moment
			    when the big yogurt man screwed over the little guy.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Anne answers for Jack, “Jack started slipping first.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I started slipping first,” he echoes. “In 2013, I came that close to
			    dying. And I was sitting in that chair over there and all my friends were

			was, that my kidneys had failed. I went to the ER and this is 2013. July 31    <sup>st</sup> or 30<sup>th</sup> in Newport here, and they did a blood test
			    on me and they said, ‘You have no kidney function.’ So, they shipped me to
			    Burlington, and I spent eight days there and got a new life out of it.” He
			    laughs in a short sputter.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We went on what they call the home program, so I don’t go to the center,
			    we do it right here. I got a good urologist who I really like. I get all my
			    care over there.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Jack pauses. The dialysis machine thumps and whirs.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “But,” he continues. “I’m gradually fading away. I have bone cancer, too,
			    because that’s what happens after prostate—it starts to spread. I just went
			    to see the radiation therapist and I have a spot here in my chest that
			    is”—he pauses again, brushes his fingers on green plaid—“growing.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Later, Jack would tell me that he thinks Green Mountain Creamery is the
			    culprit, too, a Greek yogurt manufacturer based out of Brattleboro, VT. We
			    are fickle consumers. Yogurt—American yogurt—is a fickle food. Yogurt, the
			    word, is Turkish in origin. Yogurt, the cultured dairy product, is
			    wide-reaching and has taken on many other names, flavors, and textures. In
			    China, where my family is from, “yogurt” is <em>nailao</em>, made with
			    goat’s milk and rice wine. Elsewhere, there is fermented buffalo, yak,
			    mare’s milk, each called something different. In the United States, it
			    began as <em>matzoon</em>, brought here and popularized by Armenian
			    immigrants Sarkis and Rose Colombosian before it was rebranded as yogurt.
			    From there, yogurt mutated—and despite the long history of fermented milk,
			    there only seemed to be room for one kind at a time.
			</p>
			<p>
			    When I was a kid growing up in Toronto, it was fruit-on-the-bottom Dannon
			    yogurt made from skim milk—<em>low fat, it’s better for you</em>, the
			    advertisements said. By the time my family moved to Hong Kong when I was
			    teenager, Greek yogurt (which also has a long and diverse history as
			    strained yogurt) was making the rounds on food and lifestyle blogs I would
			    read in my spare time. It is high in protein, the bloggers wrote, invoking
			    the latest nutrition trend. I never had much luck finding any Greek yogurt
			    in the store across the street. I kept my own blog back then, had installed
			    a New York City theme on it, the Brooklyn skyline sweeping across the
			    bottom of my screen in black and white grunge. I dreamt of going to school
			    in New York and having matching throw pillows in my well-lit dorm and
			    drinking superfood Greek yogurt smoothies in the mornings. I wasn’t alone.
			    At the international school I went to, anything remotely British or
			    American was supreme. Most of us wanted to leave. For me, and the friend
			    who would squeal, “Oh my god, <em>Chobani” </em>when we would make a rare
			    discovery of the stuff, there was something desirable and comforting about
			    controlling the minute aesthetics of a lifestyle, something dainty and
			    civilized about attending to your body so closely when all around us, in a
			    city of rice and meat, eating seemed so cavalier.
			</p>
			<p>
			    When I came to college in the U.S., I bought tubs of Greek yogurt for
			    breakfast, not ever liking the stuff much, leaving containers half-full in
			    the fridge until the insides were stippled with pink mold. I don’t eat much
			    of it anymore. These days, I don’t care much for healthful eating—or at
			    least the kind that’s measured in grams of protein or fat. Besides, I hear
			    Greek yogurt might be on its way out, its sales giving way to plant
			    yogurts—better for the environment, they say—and Icelandic skyr—even higher
			    in protein. But still, Green Mountain Creamery looms large in Vermont,
			    capitalizing on the state’s identity of pastoralism and local food, which
			    Jack had been riding on since the beginning. Last year, Green Mountain
			    Creamery was bought by Lactalis, the largest dairy company in the world,
			    which had two years earlier acquired Stonyfield Organic. From where Jack
			    sits, it is only the latest in a long history of corporate consolidation,
			    of national and global strands pulling taut over his corner of secluded
			    Vermont.

			    “What’d you do with my blood pressure cuff?” Jack asks. “Oh, there it is.”
			    He peels the grey cuff open, a crackle of Velcro and nylon, and then he
			    begins telling me about roots.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The roots of agriculture—literally—used to run deep. Take a cross-section
			    and there would have been pale etchings of light cream on topsoil as black
			    as liquid night. The roots tunnel deeper into the horizon
			    below, an earth of dark cocoa, and then deeper still, where they run up
			    against rocks that will in time crumble and become soil, too. Down in this
			    cold swath of darkness, microscopic wisps sprout from the plant’s tendrils
			    in a furry sheath. These hairs—they gather energy and then pull molecules
			    of nitrates and potassium and phosphorous into themselves, like trying to
			    pack an already crowded bus, and then the nutrients traverse another
			    membrane, where they shoot up a bundle of straws, up to where the plant
			    breaches the surface of the earth, up to the tips of its body. All along
			    itself, in the hearts of cells, the compounds are disassembled into ions
			    and folded into a cyclical conspiration between the sun and the soil.
			    Nitrates turn nitrites that are then slotted into the bodies of other
			    molecules, and then we have more still: proteins, enzymes, chlorophyll. The
			    plant breathes, grows, displaces the air around it with its own mass.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Often, the roots cannot get enough on their own, so they enlist the body of
			    another. Mycorrhizal fungi: a web of glassy, hollow threads knitted in
			    between the roots of this plant, and the one to its left, and the one down
			    at the other end of the field, a subterranean skeleton holding crumbs of
			    soil together. When the roots find its surroundings in want of nutrients,
			    the fungal network clutches onto, say, a phosphorous molecule, and
			    transports it eight inches, a foot away to the tips of the root hairs,
			    where, Jack tells me, it will barter the molecule for a bundle of plant
			    sugars. And thus, two lives, and more, bound together. This is how the land
			    used to work.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The blood pressure machine, a thing of white plastic, blinks a set of final
			    digits.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Okay, let’s get this thing confirmed. Yew, let’s see.” Jack swipes around
			    on an iPad. “Today was two hours and 57 minutes,” he says. “Not bad, huh?!”
			</p>
			<p>
			    The housekeeper is here to vacuum the house.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “So, Jack if you take the lawn chairs that are out by the greenhouse out
			    there–” Anne says.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Yeah, we can sit outside,” Jack says.
			</p>
			<p>
			    A lazy breeze is pooling in; the white sheet of cloud is beginning to
			    clear. Outside, it is pasture on pasture, ending at a hedge of trees
			    pitching down toward the base of the valley. Above the treetops, hazy
			    blue-green outlines of the mountain range forming the eastern rim of the
			    basin. While many others let their cows graze until the blades stand a mere
			    inch above the earth, Jack leaves his grass long: thick and sloping blades
			    that cover my ankles. Below me is a root network that is as deep as the
			    grass is tall, a mirror of what is above ground. Inside each blade,
			    microscopic green beads filled with a clear gel-like fluid capture sunlight
			    and put it away in compounds. Later, these green beads will use the energy
			    to reduce carbon dioxide into oxygen and sugar molecules, the latter
			    traveling down to build up the roots, and eventually to the soil
			    organisms—fungi—that the roots barter with, making a soil rich in humus —
			    carbon content fixed from the atmosphere and into the earth. Jack says the
			    cows can tell the difference, turning their muzzles up at hay cut on their
			    satellite fields, which until recently have been plowed year after year,
			    root structures torn up again and again to grow grain for the cows and the
			    bread for the people. But here, on the home farm, where roots have been
			    intact for 35 years, the soil is rich with organic matter, a rich sandy
			    loam.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Elsewhere, the soil is crumbling. Beginning in the 1930s, soils in the
			    United States have been precipitously leached of their natural fertility,
			    nutrients—nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium—that are produced by biological
			    processes that interlock and depend on each other. The first crack in the
			    cyclical conspiration between the sun and the soil was brought by the
			    development of hybrid crops in the first decade of the 20<sup>th</sup>
			    century. There were hybrids that came before, but the hybridization of
			    corn—a crop that by 1910 already made up a third of major cropland—was a
			    watershed moment of sorts, precipitating almost an entire century of
			    intensification that would come to define contemporary agriculture in the
			    United States and across the world.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Hybrids are produced by crossbreeding two distinct inbred varieties:
			    varieties that have over a few generations of selective breeding become
			    genetically uniform. Inbred varieties are stunted; yields tend to plateau
			    after years of breeding for advantageous characteristics. But breed two
			    together and by some biological sorcery, yields grow. Up until then,
			    corn yields had grown at 20 bushels an acre at least since the 1850s;
			    hybrids doubled, and then tripled yields. Compelled by the low prices of
			    the Great Depression, farmers latched onto hybrids. In 1935 Iowa, hybrid
			    corn made up 10% of the crop. By the end of the decade, almost all of the
			    corn planted in the state were hybrid varieties. After Iowa, the rest of
			    the country soon caught on. Today, the majority of cropland grows some kind
			    of hybrid plant—soybeans, cotton, wheat—rising out of the ground in uniform
			    blocks. <a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>12</sup></a>
			</p>
			<p>
			    Soil biology works like a game of tug-of-war. Add on one side; subtract
			    from the other. Fatten your yields; drain your soils. Hybrid corn is
			    hungry. Keep planting corn—or any other nutrient-intensive crop—year after
			    year on the same field, and it will become sick—“corn sick”. Keep planting
			    and soon the field will grow nothing at all. And so, the farmers kept
			    rotating their crops as they had always done, planting legumes—soybeans,
			    alfalfa, clover—that drew nitrogen from the atmosphere and fixed it into
			    the soil, restoring what the corn had taken, before giving the field to
			    corn again the year after. New forests of hybrids, taking more from the
			    earth than their parents had, but rotating and rotating to stagger their
			    intake, a slow pinwheel of green and yellow and brown and green.

				And then came the chemical residue of two World Wars. Before World War I, chemical manufacturers in the United States had produced chemicals like sulfuric acid as fertilizer, although their potency was nowhere near what would come after the wars—readily available nitrates and other synthetic fertilizers that would bolster food production in the country. Aside from these domestically produced fertilizers, farmers before the war used imported mineral nitrates from a desert in northern Chile, compounds pulled out of barren earth where lush Tamarugo trees—a kind of mesquite species—once stood. There was an abundance of mineral nitrates here, purportedly enough to sustain exports for 130 more years at the time. <a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>13</sup></a>  But an impending war and the need for nitrate-based explosives created concern that the war would impinge on fertilizer resources, thus hastening U.S. research in nitrogen fixing—a highly efficient method of producing ammonia that German scientists Fritz Haber and Karl Bosch had already developed years prior. In 1916, the United States Congress passed a National Defense Act, in which $20,000,000 was set aside to build munition plants for wartime, that would then be transitioned to produce fertilizers in times of peace. Wartime plant construction, in addition to the privatization of the fertilizer industry after the Second World War, led to massive increases in production and a doubling of fertilizer use between 1940 and 1950. <a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>14</sup></a>   
			</p>
			<p>
			    The arrival of synthetic fertilizer
			    loosened farmers’ concerns about draining the nutritional reserves in their
			    soils. It was the best way to farm, a march into the future, a revolution.
			    In Vermont, railroad cars packed with fertilizer would come rumbling in the
			    fall as the mountains became tinged with red. At the train station, farmers
			    would line up bumper-to-bumper with their pickups, waiting to load 80-pound
			    brown paper bags of crystalline phosphorous fertilizer—superphosphate, it
			    is called—onto the ridged bottoms of their truckbeds. All of it was very
			    cheap—the murky white crystals, the fuel it took to bring it across the
			    country, the high-energy manufacture of the fertilizer—at least, to the
			    farmers who would spread it thick on their fields, hill farms and
			    river-bottom land alike, just as the extension agents had told them to.
			    Between 1940 and 1960, under heavy USDA subsidies, Vermont imported more
			    than 10,000 tons of superphosphate.

			    Yields shot up; today, average corn yield sits at 168 bushels an acre, up

			    but stopped rotating their crops, instead relying on synthetic fertilizers
			    to replenish what had been lost the season before. Low grain prices
			    incentivized farmers to produce more to make up for fixed costs; what
			    surplus corn wasn’t piled up around bloated grain silos would make its way
			    into most things we eat and do—corn oil in fortified milk, firework powder,

			<p>
			    There was no federal legislation on organic agriculture then. If anything,
			    organic agriculture had been spurned by the USDA as a movement of
			    out-of-touch hippies who were paving a road toward starvation. But the
			    energy crisis of the mid-1970s called attention to the precariousness of an
			    intensive, high-input agricultural system, and the USDA set out to gather
			    information on what had already been done by organic producers. It was a
			    variegated landscape, dependent on what farmers thought was good for their
			    land. Some used limited amounts of pesticides and fertilizers, others only
			    depended on rotating their fields with legumes. Farmers on non-irrigated
			    land did things different from those who did irrigate. Some tilled their
			    soil; others left roots in the ground. But across the board, a 1980 USDA
			    report spelled out some basic tenets for organic agriculture. <a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>16</sup></a>
			</p>
			<p>
			    1. Nature is Life
			</p>
			<p>
			    2. Soil is the Source of Life
			</p>
			<p>
			    3. Feed the Soil, Not the Plant
			</p>
			<p>
			    4. Diversify Production Systems
			</p>
			<p>
			    5. Independence
			</p>
			<p>
			    6. Antimaterialism
			</p>
			<p>
			    “So the thing about organic is that it has so many levels of meaning for so
			    many people,” Jack says. “Traditionally, organic has been customer-based.”
			    He puts on a deep voice and scrunches up his face. “We don’t use any
			    antibiotics, pesticide, poisons.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Which is true!” Anne pipes up.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Which is true,” Jack repeats. “But there’s so much more to that, you know?
			    It’s all about seeing the whole picture.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    In many ways, it was certification that cemented organic agriculture’s
			    orientation toward the consumer, steering a movement away from a much
			    stronger philosophy of caring for the earth. By the early 1980s, many
			    states had their own private certification agencies, each with their own
			    set of rules governing organic practice. Many grew out of organic farming
			    associations that were founded by self-proclaimed back-to-the-land hippies,
			    those that had wrapped themselves in the supposedly countercultural
			    language of that era: in the organization’s early years, members of the
			    California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF)—one of the first certifying
			    programs in the country—would refer to their annual meetings as “tribal
			    gatherings.” <a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>17</sup></a>
			</p>
			<p>
			    When Jack helped write the standards for organic dairy around 1987,
			    certification for vegetable and fruit farmers had already been operating
			    for more than a decade. It happened all at once: following the founding of
			    CCOF in 1973, and then of 11 more regional certification programs by the
			    end of the next year, the organic movement saw its first legislative
			    recognition in the California Organic Foods Act of 1976. Vermont Organic
			    Farmers began certifying in 1985. And yet few standards had been written
			    officially about specialized dairy production. Through the lens of
			    certification, dairy farmers were latecomers to the movement.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In truth, a small number of dairy farmers in the Northeast and Midwest were
			    farming in response to an industrial imperative—in ways we would now call
			    organic—since the 1960s. But lacking a market to sell their milk, these
			    farmers sold to conventional processors at a loss.<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>18</sup></a> It wasn’t until after
			    the mid-1980s—right about when Jack began gathering farmers in
			    kitchens—that an organic milk market became viable. Popular media coverage
			    of a newly synthesized production-enhancing hormone (rBST) increased
			    consumer concern over adulterations to their milk and created an opening
			    for a new hormone-free, organic milk to enter the market. When rBST was
			    officially approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1994, organic
			    milk sales became the fastest growing share in the organic market. By 1999,
			    sales increased more than 500%. Certification offered a kind of consumer
			    legibility during this time, a way for consumers to parse bad foods from
			    good ones.
			</p>
			<p>
			    At the same time, the federal government was working to harmonize these
			    regional certification bodies into a National Organic Program (NOP), which
			    was first proposed in the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990. An explicit
			    purpose of the NOP was to incentivize farmers to transition to less
			    energy-intensive practices without requiring federal subsidies to make up
			    for declines in efficiency.<a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>19</sup></a> In other words, the NOP was able to further
			    augment consumer legibility for organic products and capitalize on a
			    consumer willingness to pay premiums. In a sense, the organic movement as
			    understood through certification has always faced the consumer, and only
			    then could producers seek additional value for products that had previously
			    only afforded slim margins.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In any case, organic is not enough for Jack these days, anyway. For the
			    past few years, it’s been grass-fed. After decades of growing grain, he
			    stopped cold turkey one year. It was a conversion experience, he tells me,
			    when he saw the difference in organic matter between his fields here at the
			    home farm with the tall grass, and his satellite fields that had been
			    plowed.

			    We find a pair of folding chairs and wander around to the other side of the

			    “One thing I’ll tell you,” Jack says, “is that I’ve always, <em>always</em>

			<p class = "p-break">
			    ____________
			</p>
			<p>
			    I was confused about how Jack seemed to deal in absolutes, about his maxims
			    on how to save the earth, so I go back to see him one day in the winter to
			    ask about his book on grain. I wondered how he could have spent decades
			    dedicated to learning about grain-growing only to give it up one year and
			    spend the next many advocating for its absence from the landscape, for a
			    reversion, of sorts, to a grass-carpeted Vermont. Recently, there’s been a
			    swell in alternative grain production around the world—part of it an
			    indigenous movement to reclaim sovereignty over who owns the food we eat.
			    Jack tells me that there are some people in central Vermont who are trying
			    to grow grain; he’s doubtful it’s the right thing to do.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The hills are meant to grow grass, he says. I think about how fast the
			    forest would come back if it wasn’t hemmed in by hay combines year after
			    year; in unmowed ditches, saplings quickly take root. I think about how
			    these grasses have only grown here in recent history—the timothy, the
			    orchard grass, the red and white clover. Before then, the Abenaki peoples
			    had been growing grain in the Connecticut River valley since at least 1100
			    A.D. They still do. In pockets around Vermont, Abenaki communities have
			    been saving the seeds of indigenous plant varieties once thought to have
			    vanished after white settlers had displaced them to rocky, less fertile
			    land. There’s a history hidden in the openness of the land, in the
			    juxtaposition of farm and forest. It’s a variegated history, part of which
			    clearings were burned out of forest and made to grow grain and many other
			    things—white scallop squash, sunflowers, ground cherries,
			    tobacco—altogether a landscape that wasn’t just good for raising livestock.
			    Seeds were brought here both as trade with other Indigenous groups, and
			    with European settlers who would pass through this land or choose to stay.
			    In short, a web of political and social exchanges made manifest in gardens
			    and in fields.
			</p>
			<p>
			    I say this not to uphold Indigenous foodways as the ideal either, but to
			    highlight how this land holds a multitude of possibilities that are
			    sometimes obscured by the feeling that dairy is irremovable from Vermont’s
			    landscape. In a 2019 survey conducted by Vermont PBS and Vermont Public
			    Radio, 93% of respondents answered that the dairy industry is important to
			    the state’s sense of self.<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>20</sup></a>
			    And while food initiatives in Vermont have an eye turned toward other kinds
			    of agricultural production, dairy remains a central focus as such
			    initiatives double down on efforts to revitalize the industry. There is a
			    lot to lose.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The dairy industry brings almost $3 million in circulating cash to Vermont
			every day, with a net economic impact of $2.2 billion each year.<a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>21</sup></a> Tourism revenue, which is
			    heavily conditional on the maintenance of this dairy landscape, brings in
			even more—$2.8 billion in 2017.    <a href="#fn:22" id="fnref:22" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>22</sup></a> As farms close—almost
			    half of them in the last decade—the social and economic fabric of Vermont
			    towns begins to fray; veterinarians, equipment dealers, hay farmers, grain
			    suppliers close their businesses, too. After decades of steady population
			    growth, Vermont has in the past few years experienced an exodus of younger
			    people, particularly in more rural towns in the Northeast Kingdom. In part,
			    a recent mandate to consolidate school districts in Vermont is driven by a
			    need to stabilize education budgets as enrollment numbers fall, a move that
			many lament as another blow to already flagging rural communities.    <a href="#fn:23" id="fnref:23" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>23</sup></a>
			</p>
			<p>
			    There’s a sense that the future of rural vitality is contingent on a return
			    to smaller scale farming, not only because the family farm ideal has been
			    so thoroughly wedded to Vermont’s identity, but also with the mindset that
			    smaller farms might be able to better adapt to new production models
			    emerging in response to the industrialization of farming. Such models, such
			    as shifting farms away from bulk sales and into value-added
			    processing—premium cheeses, yogurts and kefirs, the like—are all part of
			    concerted efforts to hold steadfastly onto dairy as core to the state’s
			    agricultural landscape. Grass-fed dairy farms like Jack’s are also expected
			    to play a significant role in the industry’s revival; sales of grass-fed
			    organic dairy products grew 56% just in 2018, no doubt boosted by
			    increasing pressures to consume in ways that are perceived to be better for
			the environment and for the local food economy.<a href="#fn:24" id="fnref:24" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>24</sup></a>
			</p>
			<p>
			    For Jack, the move to a model where small farms make a comeback in Vermont,
			    this time more resilient to forces of industrialization, is the antidote to
			    capitalism. But Jack’s vision of grass-fed dairy to save the earth is
			    another kind of capitalist fantasy, one where small family-run businesses
			    can virtuously reap the benefits of commercialized agriculture, a safe
			    haven around which the winds of a perverted kind of capitalism continue to
			    rage. Of course, grass-fed dairy —and organic dairy, too—have their
			    environmental benefits—at least in terms of water quality and soil erosion
			    (their value as more carbon-neutral practices is still debated).<a href="#fn:25" id="fnref:25" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>25</sup></a> But Jack’s
			    absolute utopia of the small grass-fed dairy farm rests on geographic
			    specialization of agriculture—that diets should be prescribed on the level
			    of the nation, and that land should be carved up to deliver. It’s a utopia
			    built upon a history capped at a century-and-a-half, a short history where
			    this land is only good for growing grass.

			    “I find it’s very interesting talking to you, because, you know, some of
			    your questions, you know, they’re”—he pauses—“hard to answer because”—he
			    pauses again, then continues, words tumbling slowly out of his mouth like
			    he’s rolled them around on his tongue first— “you want to know the details
			    and you want to know it in sort of black and white and it’s much more
			    involved than being in black and white, especially when you’re dealing with
			    dreams and–” He trails off. He had his hand on his chin and he lets it fall
			    to his lap. “I don’t know,” he says. “Plans for the future, or…a dream. I
			    mean this place is our dream! We started with nothing here, and we built
			    all this! From scratch! And here we are. I’m 68 and Anne will be 68 in
			    about a week and I guess I’m 69 in May—I’m doing this.” He gestures at the
			    tubes in his arm. “We’re in a time when dairy farming’s got some real
			    challenges, you know, we got issues on one hand, but on the other hand, we
			    do have some really incredible people that work here and they work for us,
			    you know, even if we’re not up there. They’re working for us. Because it’s
			    our farm still. Despite my health issues and everything else, we have so
			    much to be thankful for. I mean look at where we are here, we’re not on a
			    main road, we’re on a dead-end road, my granddaughter goes out running all
			    summer long without shoes. There’s hardly a car that drives down this road
			    all day long, except maybe the ones that are coming here and delivering
			    stuff, you know, beautiful views,” he trails off again.
			</p>
			<p>
			    I’m not sure what to say so I ask about Irasburg again, and he tells me
			    once more about the small house and the small barn and the $60 they paid
			    for rent back then. And then he continues, “You know, it’s so interesting,
			    I guess, over the years. We met so many old-timers who influenced us and
			    from home we learned a lot. About farming. About life. And now, we’re
			    becoming the old-timers. Working with folks like yourself, you know?
			    Telling our story here to different… different people. And you know, we’re
			    dealing with mortality, you know, I think Anne’s going to live a long, long
			    time, and she takes tremendous care of herself, and me, I haven’t really
			    taken care of myself like she has, you know, and I still like hot dogs, and
			    stuff like that.” He chuckles, quietly. “Smoked a fair amount of dope in my
			    day. Breathed a lot of dust.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    He lets his hands fall again.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Paying for my sins now.”

			    In October, around 20 dairy farmers from Orleans County gathered at a
			    restaurant in Newport for a meeting put on by Organic Valley. These
			    meetings are held twice a year in locations across the country, three in
			    Vermont alone, where Organic Valley has 125 members. A long window at the
			    back of the room presents a glassy Lake Memphremagog and a hill sporting
			    the last of fall colors. The farmers here are mostly men upward of 60 years
			    old. A handful are younger in their mid-20s to 40s. They sit three or four
			    to a table covered with white tablecloths.
			</p>
			<p>
			    John Cleary, the New England Regional Coordinator for Organic Valley, is a
			    thin man with a concave frame and a serious, almost forlorn look. He stands
			    in front of the room with a remote clicker, sweeping through a slew of
			    presentation slides reporting the cooperative’s finances and strategies for
			    the past two quarters. Organic Valley has undergone a significant
			    restructuring since the arrival of a new CEO in March 2019, only the second
			    from when the cooperative was founded in 1988 by a group of eight farmers
			    in Wisconsin. This is the first regional pool meeting since then. At every
			    corner is an attempt to remind famers of their importance to the
			    cooperative, comforts delivered against an increasingly volatile backdrop
			    of the dairy crisis that has manifested itself deeply in the organic sector
			    in the past few years. Early in the morning, board member and farmer Keith
			    Wilson stands with his hands in his jean pockets, and says, “I’m here to
			    listen to you.” His eyebrows are tipped on its ends and he is scanning the
			    room to look squarely at crowd members. He senses a collective
			    apprehension. Later, Cleary will tell the farmers that this is the
			    cooperative’s third year operating on a budget deficit.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Organic milk consumption has dropped in the past few years as nut milks
			    bump organic dairy out as the most ethical and healthy milk choice. In
			    response, Organic Valley has pushed out a new product to target
			    health-conscious consumers, mothers in particular. ‘Ultra’ is the latest of
			    consumer-targeted efforts by Organic Valley to find a place for fluid milk
			    in a bloated market, and a climate in which consumers are increasingly
			    attuned to purportedly more moral or healthful ways of eating. ‘Ultra’
			    stands in for ultra-filtered milk: after the cow is drained and the milk
			    trucked to a plant, the skim milk is centrifugally separated from the fat,
			    then drawn through a fine membrane that removes most of the water and
			    lactose, and flooded with the lactase enzyme for a lactose-free product.
			    Finally, as with regular milk, the skim is rejoined with varying volumes of
			    fat to make whole milk—3.5% fat—2%, and 1%. The tune of Ultra is played on
			    repeat by staff members from Organic Valley this morning, from the moment
			    farmers settled into their seats and had presentation slides paint out
			    shrinking margins, until the very end, when the chairs were almost empty,
			    and the Organic Valley salesman in the corner beckons stragglers to pick up
			    a carton of Organic Valley Ultra™ for the farmhouse fridge. After a
			    particularly long onslaught of Ultra excitement in videos from the
			    marketing team, John jokes, “I know, if we hear anyone say the word ‘Ultra
			    one more time…” He gives a short chuckle.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Earlier this year, this project began to carry the shadows of a tragedy in
			    three acts—the grassroots emergence of organic, its economic success, and
			    the fall of organic dairy, as consumer choices and food values begin to
			    reshape this landscape once more. But the arrival of COVID-19 spelled out a
			    different trajectory for organic dairy, at least for the time being. The
			    pandemic has disrupted much of food production in the United States. Highly
			    centralized meat plants have closed—some far too late, at the expense of
			    thousands of lives—lobbing off large shares of the country’s food supply:
			    the first pork plant that closed in South Dakota produced 5% of the pork
			    consumed in the United States.<a href="#fn:26" id="fnref:26" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>26</sup></a> At Vermont’s conventional dairy farms, milk
			    trucks drove out to empty fields and dumped milk, as processors closed
			    their doors, too. But the organic dairy industry has been reinvigorated in
			    the midst of this pandemic.
			</p>
			<p>
			    When I call Spud to catch up in March, he tells me that almost all of
			    Organic Valley’s milk is going toward making fluid sales—as opposed to
			    butter, cream and cheese, which, as less perishable products, serve as a
			    kind of buffer in times of low fluid milk demand. But consumers are
			    drinking more organic milk in quarantine. “People are paying more attention
			    their health, I guess,” Spud says. But the boost of sales in organic dairy
			    is more likely due to its lack of a role in wholesale markets; while much
			    of conventional dairy is consumed in school or restaurant settings, organic
			    dairy is mostly purchased off the shelf at grocery stores and in this way
			    remained sheltered from the loss of school and restaurant accounts. As
			    schools and businesses closed, processors turned away conventional milk,
			    and farmers dumped milk, a brief shortage in milk supply pushed consumers
			    toward organic dairy. Spud’s been producing over his quota for a few months
			    now, being paid much less for the surplus. But because all his milk is now
			    going to market, he expects to be compensated at the end of the year at the
			    full price. Maybe Organic Valley will raise his quota, too.
			</p>
			<p>
			    While the pandemic has upended food systems across the United States, it is
			    in many respects only crisis made tragically apparent. Decades of low
			    prices, overproduction and heavy consolidation has made it particularly
			    vulnerable to systemic failure in the face of a health crisis. Sprawling
			    supply chains are rigidly connected, as evidenced by the thousands of
			    gallons of milk dumped on fields and into manure pits, even as food
			    pantries remained in need.<a href="#fn:27" id="fnref:27" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>27</sup></a> Lately, centralized processing facilities that
			    employ thousands in refrigerated assembly lines remain open under Trump’s
			    executive order declaring meat processing plants “critical infrastructure,”
			    a move made after weeks of lobbying by meat monopolies.<a href="#fn:28" id="fnref:28" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>28</sup></a> It’s a quiet crisis
			    turned rolling boil.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The positive outcome of organic dairy is not so much a testament to its
			    separation from a food system always in crisis, but more so a result of its
			    specific configuration within that system: in the retail market and not
			    elsewhere. Only months ago, organic dairy farmers were beleaguered by a
			    market downturn after years of enjoying high milk prices, a reminder of the
			    tendency for our food system to create moments of relief within itself—in
			    this case, for farmers to seek additional value in organic
			    production—before these, too, are swallowed up.
			</p>
			<p style = "margin-bottom: 300px">
			    Much of food system reform is framed around making ethical consumption
			    choices, around “buying local,” as though food systems are bounded
			    geographic regions in which a consumer dollar has a direct impact on farmer
			    livelihoods. But the history of Vermont’s landscape, its shaping by the
			    flows of commodities and people, suggests something quite contrary to a
			    contained food system. The pastoral Missisquoi River valley is a stillness
			    made from movement, a product of farmer’s choices to farm organically in
			    response to a depressed national milk market, itself an aggregate of
			    deregulatory agricultural policy and technological changes. It’s a
			    landscape dynamic not only in the way organic dairy is now teetering
			    between decline or a resurgence, but also how it in its cultural weight, in
			    its resemblance to an imagined past, has drawn many like Jack Lazor to the
			    state, bringing philosophies that take root and coalesce into new industry,
			    keeping farms, like Spud Edward’s, green and in charming juxtaposition to a backdrop of forested mountains.

		<h6>The Western Abenaki, whose historical territory covers most of what is today Vermont, New Hampshire, western Maine and southern Quebec, began farming in the Connecticut River Valley as early as 1100 A.D., growing a diverse range of corn, bean, and squash varieties in fields cleared by burning forests. Some varieties, such as Koasek corn, were—and are still—cultivated from plants native to this region. Others, like Jacob’s Cattle bean, were acquired through trade with European settlers, who were in some cases gifted these varieties by other Indigenous communities in the Northeast and beyond.
		From the beginning, agriculture in this region has constantly been evolving as social and political relations were folded into complex practices of crop cultivation. However, until more recently, Indigenous methods of food production have gone unmentioned, or have played a backseat role in Vermont’s major food movements. Additionally, the role of Indigenous knowledge in shaping dominant agricultural practices is often papered over, following a long history of positioning indigeneity as antithetical to modernity in Western scientific communities. <br> <br>Jan Albers, Hands on the Land: A History of the Vermont Landscape, 1st ed (Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 2000); Amanda Gokee, <a href = "https://www.vnews.com/Heritage-corn-being-grown-in-Valley-31848955">“High Stakes for Small Ears: Seed Stewards Preserve Native Varieties of Corn, Other Plants,” Valley News, January 11, 2020.</a>; See also the <a href = "https://nitcnrcsbase-www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1101651.pdf">Abenaki Heritage Garden</a> at the Intervale Center in Burlington, VT for more information regarding traditional Abenaki crops.
